so time is flying again.
but it was amazing. especially yesterday.
we had a great sex last night.
I just felt more love with her.
because of the conversation after our thought.
philosophy. that we need to take care of more 'now'.
not the future or past.

'sharable contents' yes. it seems matter.
but what would be sharable contents for farm, and digital nomad couple?
should I have to share how to workexchange, and writing the email?
well, thesedays, just the workexchange can be done by chatgpt wroten essay or email with that.

yes. interesting.
yeah. life. it seems much better.
we should have to enjoy this moment more.
but yeah. we need to focus on 'now' too.
we need to time to focus on.

**the sharable contents.**
1. farm to table contents.
- Mushroom KFC

2. Success stories and case studies
- spring water story
- creation this site

but I wonder what kind of questions do I have to create?
1. how did you think about creating a farm in here?
2. why you think creating a farm here is important?
3. what was most difficult part?
4. what made you keep this building process continue?
5. what would you like to advise if someone wants create his own.
6. How did you meet Shen?
7. when you decide to be with her?
8. I heard you came across here from Pai, is there any reason of it?
9. What is different of Pai and Nan?
10. If you want to add something for your farm, what would it be?
11. If there is a thing you want to say something for world?

---

interesting, there is many things we should have to keep thinking about it.
so we need to keep edit some videos, and dealing with her occupations.
it shouldn't be so complicated.
how can we make it simpler, and stable?
we couldn't just let everything goes complicated.
we should have to make those things super simpler.

---

that was difficult. what is the best easy way to make it simply hanging there?
yeah. Mary's thought about her future should be organized to make a decision.
why? because, we don't know what is her priority.
what she simply want to achieve, need to be figured out in first?

what about myself?
yes. myself, I want to know something for myself.
all good. I feel happy with everything that I have here.
but I'm curious what should I do for next?
yes.
we want to carry out something for ourselves.

do we have to figure out another place for that?
hm... I don't know.
from 1st, if there is no place, then yes we should have to figure it out.

from the 1st...
but whatever it does, should we have to figure out something?
hm... yeah.
what would be best option for us?
- stay together
- learn something bring us ubundance.


# yes. we should have to figure out, when we put our time, where we could gain most value for ourselves?

1. how it works for me?
I want to learn coding, bring more speed and make myself much more differenciate from others.
why?
because that will help me to make more abundance.
what is the abundance mean exactly?
I would love to know some bring me more value.
what would it be?
I don't know.

**but problem solving skillset?**
yes so true. but there is something I should know. one thing I can make a solution but, the solution should have to solve a problem in bulk.
yes.

but what do we want to do for future?
she does like to yoga. yes she can do yoga wherever she goes.
that is great thing.

yes. then melbourne seems good place to go there.
but what about the place the others.
the thing she should consider is the passport expiration.

# Point 1

**when would her passport will be expired?**
yes this does matter because,


**but what about my life?**
yes. my life. I should have to build my empire. right? but, yes I want to be with her Mary.
I don't need to think about the other ways.
but if I have to think about it?
It would be super triste. almost I cannot handle it.
yeah.
then what should I think about?

the plan. whether she is here or not.
yes. that would be critically does matter.
what would the best option for us?
or for me?

learning something very useful for us.
what would it be?
videography skillsets are already very critical.
and story telling skillset also very critical.
should have to offering more information about that.

should i have to write down my dreams, and reasons?
yes. I already put the things down. nope?
yeah. well being with her is more excited.
I just want to financially strengthen myself.
**why? because finance seems the things to help me out so hard.**
wherever I go, how much my dream change, the abundance will not go anywhere?
yeah.
it will keep me survive. and my debt as well.

**then how can we strengthen our financial health?**
yeah the financial health seems does matter.

financial health.
what is financial health? would it be the top priority for us?
hella yes.
but surviving isn't our way to achieve. rather I want to achieve the way of successfully survivng.
thriving. how can we make it?
yes. as Shen mentioned, money can be just illusion.
but, also it helps to our survive. how it works.

Money... Yes we already know some strategy how to gain those abundance.
we live in a world.
Financial Health does matter. not just how to survive from nature.
yes.

**Financial Health and How to be abundance within nature both do matter.**
How can we strengthen those two abilities for ourselves?

# Financial Heatlh
1. Investment, Business Management Wise.
yes this is crucial. If I know very well about business, I could understand about well investment as well. then how can we learn about those two?

well, we can learn Compounding Effects. If we could find a strong corporation to keep thriving with our investments, that is a good option. but the numbers do matter too.

but we want to invest for ourselves tool. one is coding, and camera. why I both love it? because those can solve some problems. Camera, what kind of problems it can solve it out? it can help people do reach out to the world. make them meet those people who willing to connect with us.
who they are? where they are? how can we find them out? as close as our copywriting matching with their needs, their reach would that be great.

**yes. the purpose of camera is reaching out people who we want to connect with.**

connection does matter. as Mary once said it too.
yes.
how can I strengthen the connections? I need to know what kind of videography, photography people want to learn.
in storytelling wise, also I am curious about it.
