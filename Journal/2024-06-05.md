well I can see it can be super difficult.
rather I should have to pick some stocks and just monitoring it.
I cannot pour all the time into that.
nvidia is one of thing to go.
apple also.

value investment can be great but I don't know would that be super great with that.
maybe just I can buy it when it is super cheap.

but it seems really difficult find out the something good stock? or my analysis midnset? all also we need to understand about them.
but until that, I should have to just put my whole budget into somewhere else. right?
but I don't know where would be great for it.
so I can just put it into somewhere else. yes let's point into not 'earning a lot' but 'lossing less'
where would be the company or something like that? gold?

but the gold seems not guaranteed as well?

1. what would make the gold price fluctuated?

2. What should I learn for investment?

- when it cheap, I can buy it. when it expensive, I can sell it.
I don't have to use the another method? no. I need to learn more about this. never ever selling it does work until it does go in that wrong or cheaper.

so what does really important?
hm.. yes.

maybe I should have to jotting down what should I do.
let's list up some goals what I want to achieve. then I can figure out what should I do for now?


what is my goal in my life?
I want to live having my own farm. why? I want to make rich and fundamental living with the farm. want to create something beautiful place for it.
how can I do that?

1. the stock kind does matter.
2. the buying timing does matter.

yes. obviously... Robert kiyosaki and Warran buffit what they think about commodities?

what does matter for now anyway? I don't know.
just important thing is to learn about something useful for myself.

the long term view.
how do I want to getting die?

## What I want to do.

a lot of charities. shared with the others. being blessed with the others. because of their approval and appreciation 'That was great to live with you' kind of life.
how can I make that kind of life?

I want to emerge that with the regenerative works. why? because I love nature. when I see a creature in nature so networked and how it does functioning in a its network ecosystem it is so interesting. how they can be super super interesting like that? the nature is miracoulous. how they can have that kind of organization in there and the way of miraclousness.
yes that is pretty dumb-ass gigantic amazing things.

then should I have to be like that? have to capture them and keep spreading the miracoulesness? it can be :) but I would like to learn about the principle of nature in first. that is the way of understanding nature. then what should I have to do? I have to keep learning about the miracoulesness of nature. how can I keep learning of it? I can listen them up, I can feel them up well.
that would be very important point and one of material to deliever the people.

If I start documenting a flower, plant, animals would be great option. maybe I can ask for the information from ChatGPT or perplexity of it. if I can understand better? then I can see what just would happen with that. I want to empower the connectivity between people and nature by introducing what the nature does in its system. yes.

but those things can be only found from nature. yes nature I should be just in there.

It's interesting that I like nature. and the fact that I find myself it from now. yes. I've been a nature person. where can I be there? where can I get there? i don't know. I don't really know. nearby the nature maybe I can be there. and understanding about that. but I don't know either. druid, I always wanted to say that I really want to be a druid. yes. that would be great some.

nature's miraclousness. I want to spread and to share with people to interwinded with that.

## how can I do that very well?

Well I should have to keep understanding the importance of it.

an idea, marriage between American and russian or Chinese.
yes. they are opponent not an enermy. that would be weirdo.
yes I'd like to blend them up.
but first I saw my body got way too much. so have to cut of my fatty belly first!
have to work out with the jumping lines.


but for now what does matter?
yes keep thinking about how to well die does matter. I want to have a shower and maybe looking for another chance with the place?
or finishing up the video editing? yes both can be important.
but I want to.. video editing in the libabry. this place is too hot.

yes twosome place I've arrived. but I don't know how long can I keep staying here.
but what can I do for now?

one thing I worry is the place doesn't make any respond. what should I do with that?
hm...
why they don't respond right now? maybe this is the kind of reason why they don't answer for it?
maybe should I have to find out another place? hella yes
