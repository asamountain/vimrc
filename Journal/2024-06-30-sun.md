yes. tomorrow we gonna having a talk with Mr Damien.
I feel so confused why I got so horny.
I feel somehow super tired.
because of masterbation?
maybe.
but the point is I figured out any hope for myself.
why I should have to do this job?
because I want to help the others.
to figure out my own life.
yes.
that is the point.
I want to make my life goes well.

what is the meaning of my life goes well?
well, we can think about the life I really want it.
I need to know what should I have to know.


what do I wanna know?
sponsorship? will it make me so happy to go?
yeah it can be. but it should have to keep thinking about what kind of stories I should have to tell for audience.
and who will be the audiences?
those people who want to support me, and those people who willing to learn about this permacultural people.
yes. I need more people who do this with us.
my pioneering can help their working as well.


I need to keep making those of options. I need to know that how can I create those videos.
yes those videos to create the connection between me and people.
what kind of connection do I want to create?
support each other, asking for information what they have to do, what they need to do.


how can I create the connecting, sharable contents for others?
It should have our story. should I tell that throughout just everything in my korean?
yes my korean seems just showing up everything what I feel right now.
should I try here? yes. let's go.

life seems not easy. something it just hurts us and asking for super harden up as an iron in a blacksmith's hit.
I don't know this life is going on. still it just force me to go where hardens me so much.
it literally makes me to do more things than I ever imagined to do, and to go.

living within sustainability also mean like this.
we should have to endure the dirt and mold conditions I should have to pass through.
this is pretty though. sometimes you cannot fall asleep because of itchness from insect bites.
you can just imagine how much our flesh fresh body can be a good attraction for insects.
I cannot count how many bits I got since I came this permacultural center.
yes. this place is quite interesting. very wild wise place.
we just tear some leaves from trees and eat it.
we don't know what is those trees or leaves name on coming table's side dishes, but we just eagerly cleaned the dishes and ate them all.
It is pretty intersting how much those wild foods can affect my body condition as well. i feel pretty good every single day, except when it goes too hot, wet.
even a nap made my mind more dizzy, so had to force myself to do yoga. stretching my back to the arch and curved to backward and toward several times. then the haziness just gone.
even though that wasn't easy to call it simply as a text just sounds. but after a few mins of dizziness can help with that. 

every night, the lighting bugs also create beautiful dots on the air. That was miraclous when they leaves dots on the air in our sleep space.
I'll remember those moments.

sometimes bring camera was super difficult, so many times I had to dirt off with my airblowers. but just after a minute there are new dust left on the surface of camera.

but still interesting life. but still difficult. I want to know more something for myself.

I want to achive the sustainable life. the sustainable mean financially strong and healthy as well. but as long as there is not many things I create for my income, I Feel so confuse. I want to work for healing people or liberating people. yes I want to give them the benefits. but it's still not easy to figure out how can I give them and earning money from it.

yes whether I want to abudance in finance or lengthening my own suffiency, all those linke with same page.
I should learn the SEO strategy for reaching out audiences. To link with specific audiences, I should understand about my desire and goals too. 

# what kind of people I want to be connected? 

1. supportive for our being
2. willing to support us
3. willing to spend money for us
4. giving us more information what we need
5. when we ask for help, they willing to help
6. really understand about us, so they willing to support and to engage what we're doing.
7. want to do the same as us, 'Work exchange volunteering', 'Homestead Permaculture' like.
8. unexpected InYeons. but good souls.

# what kinds of contents will they love? 

1. **genuine contents. they would love to see our genuinity.** maybe a journaled video.
2. the permacultural things.
3. showing our love for the world.

then the process to create contents should start from text.

yes. and I should increase my investment margin as well. even though I learned of safety margin, I'd like to gain much more income of it. then should I try more active investment? but there are too many activities I've engaged with. seems none of them works well for now. but yes we can try to expanding the margin of achievement. 

# how can we do that? what kinds of margin should we expand wider?

1. My marketing result.
- the farm where we stay, has to have more engagement(Farm visit, Course Registration, Volunteering, Product Purchasing)

    then the subtitle should be turned on all the times, to give better user experience. how could I turn it on?

~~(is there any of grammar correcting app for vim journaling?)~~

- farm to table option should be done. 

    because people want to know how a herb can be cooked in a pot and becomes a food for it. I should keep following her harvesting. of course I taught Jon how to film those videos, I should teach more sincerely. like how to attatch the logo. he already got a lot of that. If he has a question, he should look up the question and learn of it.
    Internet can be a necessary for him.

2. those overall results should be quantified.

- like, how many videos uploaded, how many engagements happened, how was the result(views, visit increasing etc)

    it seems interesting but also very confusing too. I am not sure what they exactly want. 


3. we should detail our dream life.

yes our dream life must be detailed. like 'we want to 600 squeremeter land, not a mountain to manage with. look! permaculture principle also mentioned, <start small>'. we must understand about this. well actually buying a huge land is unrealistic goal. so we should start small. that is much better. first of all we can start from using another's land first. from very small scale to huge scale.

---

it's very interesting there are a ton of process that I should understand. the audiences. who they are, what they want to know. those kinds of understanding would be huge progression for us and for the farm where we stay. 

# how can we understand about the audiences? who are those audiences?

maybe I shoud look up AI search engine.

I found understanding about the audience who must interest Permaculture, also very strategically important for us. we can understand what kinds of words they use, who they are. the connection-wise, that is super important for us. we'd like to connect with those people who like-minded. so if we can understsand about them well, we can create strong connection with them. even in the future, Youtube, we can figure out how could we continue the connections with them.

we will figure out the way to attract them as well. so I can visioning the view in long term, how our works will unfold to the future. but linked-in wise, I don't know the linkedin would be strongly impacting us.
but using linked-in can be a good option. but I'd like to share those experiences throughout youtube, within a lot of descriptions. that can much easier to gather all my resources as a experience journaling can be gathered in one place. youtube also connected with google, they can be very nice place to gathering all my progresses as a regenerative culture initiative especially content marketer.

as much as I use the ai search engine, sonnet 3.5 or chatgpt and perplexity about the future audiences, I can understand better. but I want to know how to document myself better? I want to shoot the footages to deliver what I want to express well. but I don't know how to film it in appropriate timing. but Claud sonnet 3.5 helped this figured out as below

```
You're right to recognize that planning your shots and storytelling can be challenging. Starting with a written structure or storyline is an excellent approach. Here's how you might proceed:

1. Begin with free writing:
   - This is a great way to start. Just write down your ideas, experiences, and observations without worrying about structure.
   - Include what you're learning, challenges you're facing, and interesting aspects of your surroundings.

2. Develop a basic structure:
   - After free writing, try to organize your thoughts into a rough outline or structure.
   - Consider a beginning (introduction to your journey), middle (daily experiences and learnings), and end (reflections or goals for the future).

3. Identify key themes:
   - Look for recurring themes in your writing. These could be personal growth, specific permaculture techniques, or cultural experiences.

4. Plan your shots:
   - Based on your structure and themes, start listing potential shots.
   - For example: wide shots of the farm, close-ups of plants or soil, time-lapses of your daily routine, interviews with local farmers.

5. Create a shot list:
   - Make a detailed list of shots you want to capture for each section of your story.
   - Include notes on composition, time of day, or specific activities you want to show.

6. Storyboard (optional):
   - If you're visually inclined, try sketching out key shots or sequences.

7. Remain flexible:
   - While planning is important, be open to spontaneous moments and unexpected stories that arise during your journey.

Remember, your initial structure doesn't have to be perfect. It will likely evolve as you spend more time on the farm and gain new experiences. The key is to start with some direction while allowing room for your story to develop organically.

Would you like some examples of potential shot types or story structures that might work well for documenting your permaculture journey?
```

so this farm, need to attract more permaculture interest people. they must willing to live simple life according to (perplexity research)[https://www.perplexity.ai/search/who-are-they-usually-attracted-7J2.OEd4SnmxI4dr6fcXbA#0]

but this Sahainan farm's gardening technique seems more like just foraging. how to eat a specific wild shrub, and why. maybe they need to look up on internet, throughout searching for the scientifical name. Maybe I should film the specific herb to heal a wound. I should film them up. maybe I just need to bring my bettery all around.

# one new habit

10 times better, how can I make it ?
money, subsriber counts, every single day happiness, English communication rate.

## Money

how can I make them all better?

1. need to figure out some way of making money. Sponsorship? Would they like to help us? yes? If I really good at helping the farm? If I can make 10 times better of the marketing, and reaching, engagements happened, It would give me 10 times more result. but how can we make it?

2. and investment wise, If I do more 10 times better to take care of something, that would be better, ain't it? thoroughly? Warren Buffett told us we need to see in long term, but this one seems not sure all about it

3. and our contents itself.
actually this is just related with num 1 option. so we just need to understand about how to make sponsorship.

but yes the next journey thing can be matter as well. 

# where should we have to go?

I have no idea actually. it is abit tiring understand about those all everythings. I feel a bit difficult with that.
yeah. why we should have to keep searching for next place? that is pretty tiring too. yeah.
then just staying in a place for long or mid term can be good right? maybe I should tell her about this.
it would be great if we can really learn something useful for our future.

yes. but where? it seems the place, havainaan the place seems nice, but no wifi, and shared toilet, seems... not sure to uppart.

I wanna know something better, yes but there is no other place to stay?

then do we need to figure out another place to stay?

daruma place seems a place to go.

yes I need a place to work as a nomad too.
**the decent WIFI actually does work well**


yes. when I have the wifi, I can upload contents more freely. If I can upload contents. It will help to empower us as well. of course planing does matter. but I wanna having the wifi well in first.
but it won't be easy.
then what should we choose?

hm... I need to know about it. how can we figure it out? we need to dream our picture in detail. then we can navigate the place where we should stay.
yes.

# what kind of place do I want to have?

1. beautiful place.
2. less moskito. repellent. less itchness.
3. good smell(like Bali Street)
4. food abundance, good cuisine
5. vegan and animal lovers
6. yoga and mindfulness oriented people together
7. learn and study possible place, wifi working
8. exercise possible.
9. safe(of course), from hygenic issue.
10. Permaculturally advanced place.
11. Financially strengthening place. (the organization already achieves the independancy, and empower others in financial way)
12. Digital nomad way we can learn better.
13. By staying there, we can dream more detail about our life, we can imagine our way of thriving it.

earth ovening, earth house building all great. but that takes a lot of times and hours. I want to know how can minimize those hardship times, and juicy benefits maximizing.
well, contents wise, I want to connect with others well, and want to encourage more.
this place is quite closed. It's super not easy to connect with the outside of world.(or I just don't know how to connect with them. my contents should work with it.)
yes I really want to know how to more easily, accesibly using it, and upload it.
yes the WIFI, decent speed does really require. If not, it would super difficullt
