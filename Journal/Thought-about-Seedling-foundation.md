tiring.
yes. I want to know for sure, what is good way to go.
but it seems a bit difficult.
why is that? because of my sturbonness?

yes. some people do the scam.
3 months of staying can be super dangerous.
what if they make some trouble with us for long term?
yes.
It should never happen.

then maybe we have to understand their volunteering opportunity. right?
why they have no others?

do we have to take the chance? but why they don't have any other options?
but the tour seems saying they do great jobs.
yeah but tour is tour.
so we have to know how is the internship experience looks like.

we can have a look for it.
I don't want to lose my authority to kept staying there by contraction.
Internship?

Should we just go for it?
no. We don't know about that.

hm...
then how we can make it easily, fast, decision?
during those time, we just lose our time, as a resource.
yes.
let's try to see that place.
and just take the go?

# how can we see the place?
visiting them.
1 week staying in Pai
near the place of Pai.
Enjoy the place.

# What about the negotiation as well?

yes.
negotiation? how much payment can we do for them?
it's also depend on how the places go as well. right?
yes. we can determine it.
actually we just want to save it, but also want to help them in financially.
but how can we calculate the amount of donation?

## how much money do they need the local farmers in usual?

5000 bath? need to research.

## 15 days staying in Pai?

would it be okay? would it be desirable for us?
well yes. we don't have to pay for that.
'negotiable' also does mean well.
yeah he is a kind of clever one.

not 15 days, we can think about 1 day or 3 day > 7 days like that.
then we can decide of it slowly.
