what should I do? yes. I feel kind of sensetive today. because I thought I might lose her just...
yes. I felt super sad. what did I do? I don't know and pretty understand about this. I just thought she must do some conditional love but she didn't. she just loved me. and still loving me. I just confused when she said like '~, You benefit me'. so the understanding of mine, I felt super sad.

yeah but this is just another thought, it doesn't that much.
I just want to love her so much. but I want to know how can I love her and myself at the same time, in many ways.
I wanna know about it.

well, yes. keep listening about her, be with her. always be with her. appreciate her.
and make her life goes as she genuinly dreams of. yeah. that would be all great to go.
I need to make sure how can I go to there.

the finance. yes. I need to know what is the great corporation. need to learn about business. then I can find out a good company, and intrinsic value calculation, I can make a good investment with that.
