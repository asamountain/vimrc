# Sahainan PDC

## Good tips from Sahainan, Shen's Speech

1. they always asked local people what to eat, what those old ladies eat.
2. Mountain blocks more of the chemical uses nearby, but flat field isn't possible to avoid it.
3. How did they build beautiful relationship with local people, neighborhood
- They just understood others who use chemicals from heart.
- They just allowed to take their own products for them e.g. Red Ants, and Banan Trees.
4. the low Farmer : Consumer ratio encourages conventional chemical farming.
5. Organic Farm is more difficult to receive Certification.
6. Certificate num 9. The Honourable king's sustainable agriculture encouragement, King No. 9.

# 2nd day

## My own meaning of Permaculture.

- The last one.
    - Systematic principle : Empower the each other in a organism, the whole is bigger than each segments total.

    ```
    this makes me thinkging about the helping each other, and establish a harmonious(helping each other) relationship, then that does matter.
    ```

- 'if your life seems too hard, you should think differently.'
- Harmonization with surround seems very important..
- Observation does matter, that is for 'Application' into my case.
- Catch and Store energy.

### Principle 10, `Use and Value Diversity`
   a Green house, chicken coop inside, planting vegetables, pond in front of entrance of green house, growing grape
   1. chickens body templerature > heat
   - growing grape vertically
   - growing plants within appropriate templature
   - chickens can goes out in some route, they can intergrate other place(such as orchard, weed control, producing eggs and manure > fertile the soil, no need weeding)
   - use the top layer of chicken coop(warm air goes up)
     * seedling much earily in spring > can win market competition or get better price than other farms
   2. Pest repellent by using fond
   - frog eats the snail, they don't have to use chemical for it.
   - Aquaculture they can create
   -    Bio Diversity

# 3rd Day

- wood vinegar : Toxic Liquids(Tanin, Nikotin etc) can be used as Repellent.
- Terminite Observation : that's why they put the concrete into their foundation.
- Best Moment to chop & down is when its flowering.(Blossom signs the peak of nitrogen.)

    **How to identify Edible Food from wild**
-   follow the Local People
-   Check by skin(put in thin skin from parm to folding part(arm pit, inside of ankle)
-   If any insect eats the mushroom
-   If Boiling Rice becomes black with the mushroom, there is poison.

## Turn Problem into Solutions.

- If there is a 'harmful' insect or creature for the plant, it means the plant isn't healthy. if the plant is super heatlhy, it means they have immune system.
-   if the soil isn't healhty, the plant is weak. the plant is weak, then the predetors can eat well. so feed the soil does hugely important.
-   if a snail comes a lot into a specific plant, it means they need a calcium or the plant has a calcium for the snail's creation of shell.
 
    ```
    maybe some of soil on the rooftop bucket had weak soil.
    ```

* How to create fertile soil?

## 4 Kinds of Designing

- Map Analisis : The whole place Analisis Needed, e.g. Directions, Sun and Water, Soil.
- Element Analysys : Element Analisis
- Sector Analysis : Energy(any natural or uncontrolled external) influence, such as Thunder, Wind, Water, Fire Risk, Pollution, Wild Life, Noise.
- Zone Analysis
    * The Zoning depends on the The Caring Necessaty, Water Supplication Possibility as well.

## When to plant?

- Better to planting before winter. because of the root will growing down to create deeper and entangled before Spring coming. If not, the root will not be created enough for being stably standed up, but the stem only got thicker, that can be fallen.

- Water should be waving to come through our home, so that can contain the oxygen inside of water, it doesn't go decaying.

- N : Nitrogen. need to make green parts.
- P : Phosphorus. Flower
- K : Potassium. Fruit

- Sillica, one of mineral : Rice,
-
- Assoke

# 4th Day 2024. 7. 4.

## Soil
- Limiting Factors.
- Loam is best status of soil. Loam is able to shape a donut.
-   if the soil can shape a round, that is more than sandy soil.
-   if the soil can shape a flat, more than sandy loam.
-   if the soil can shape a donnut, more than it is clay roam
- Organic Matter burying is good way to healthy soil.
- Living Pyramide for Eco-System, the bottom layered creatures should be a lot to thicker the whole pyramid size.
- NPK needs binder.
- Salty water can just kill the microbe in root, because of the microbe's water would be deluted out. Every creature needs water to survive.
- Hairly Root signs of strong immune system for the plant. ~~then, Perrenials usually more stronger for immune system? > We cannot call like that - Shen ~~ and it really seems so[https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-npk-nutrients-for-WFYKlDhMTBq_h1sYKAKohw#:~:text=perennial%20plants%20have%20developed%20unique%20adaptations%20and%20defense%20mechanisms%20to%20survive%20over%20multiple%20growing%20seasons%3A]

## Soil Improvement

- a lot of methods

## Compost

- 1 Nitrogen : 25 Carbon is ideal
- Carbon : Brown things(like old leaf, soda, hay, branch, Ash, Em, Healthy Soil) 
- Nitrogen : Green colored(Cow poo)
- Animal Size smaller the higher nitrozen even though that is high nitrogen. ~~Why is that?~~


    * -----------------------------------
    * Nitrogen 
    * Ash : Bringing more alcaline('most soils are acidic' ~~but why?~~) and Minerals
    * Water
    * Green Layer
    * Brown Layer
    * ------------------------------------
  
* the height should be 0.5 meter. for heating metric generating well.


- height, weight encouraged 1 meters

- Bacteria, Aerobic and Anerobic
-   Aerobic Compost : No smell
-   Anaerobic : Storng Smell

~~Learning about Bacteria seems important as well, a lot of factors within Bacteria ecosystem related with Agriculture and nature~~

### Signs to identify composting status

1. Smelly = not working
2. Temperature too high > succesful
3. 1-4-6-8-10-12-14-16 days, the things should have to be turn in and out.
4. Higher than 65c is risky, all bacteria can dead. 

### EM - Effective Microbe

1. Creation Ratio = 1 : 3 : 10  = Sugar : Fruit/Veg : Water(H2O) = Aerobic Bacteria.
* the Fruits and Vegs don't have salt or oil.
* Terminite Home also can be an ingredient. - 2 Terminite : 5 Rices : 20 Water. No need stirring(No Need Oxyzen)
2. Preparation = Bottle.
3. 3 Months Usually needed.

## Patterns

1. Rice Field creation, They do encouraging stamping to the ground.~~ It takes 2 weeks? ~~
2. They use Nitrogen Fixing plant by creating a seed barm.
* Lemon grass and a rice can survive in water.
3. Rice is the best for Sahainan's climate. and also nutrients are great but the process is simpler than other crops.
* storing should be considered.

* To choose Shen is because of 'same mind', and both out of control. 
* If every Composting method has a strength and weak, what kind of compost would be great for the site?

    - Hugelkultur : Hihgly Self-Regulate, but needs a lot input from initial stage.

## Propagation

1. By Root : Auxin. A Hormone to stimulate more roots. Putting them into soil pile, it will create sprout.
2. Branch Cutting : remove many leaves when it's not sunny then throughout night they will prepare robust by creating a lot of roots.
3. Flower : Pineapple.
4. Marcotting : from Branch, generate roots from the middle of branch, but doesn't generate the main root, so in harsh climate, the marcotting generated plant cannot be survive well.
5. Grafting : Same family possible to combine with others.

## Fever

1. Fever is symptom of immunsystem. Our body tries to fight against bacteria. All Immune system goes for the war, it makes heat.
2. Kept above 40'c 3days, must go Hospital.
3. Cloth and warm water better.

## Water

1. 2cm level gaps between two points per 100m. 2%
2. Catch and Store Strategy
3. DGB Water
- Drinking Water
- Grey Water : After Shower
- Black Water : Human Manual

4. 0.26 % water can be only usable for human usage. so Need to keep the water as many as possible.
- Planting
- Pond
- Swale : on tour.(등고선)
- Dams we need
- Tank
- Mulching

5. Toilet 
- Stone & Concrete Wall. No bottom.
- Gac tree fulfills the manual tank, better remove it.
- Methan Gas on the tank, they collects the gas, and use as bio-gas. ~~ How to keep the safety from fire accident ~~

# Agroforestry

## Stratigication

* Percentage means how many sunlight do they like
* We can stack them within consideration of Sunlight how much they can achieve
* Very nice for attaining biomass

1. Emergenta(100%)
- Eucalyptus
2. Canopy(80%)
- Raintree

1. Banana Tree is very good biomass and mulching
2. After 3 years, there would be no need mulch species
3. Bacteria Growing is his recommendation for fertile the soil.
- Worm Farming in Bathtub
- Soak Charcoal into EM liquid
4. 1 for you, 1 for rat, 1 for other people.
5. Rats make a very nice ternal in soil.
6. Everyone gets happy, if you're 'being with' them. but if not, it goes 'against with that' so it makes suffering and sadness.

## Plate

1. Main Tree in a middle of Circle.
* Full sun - Cassava is good choice


# Natural Building

1. Soil 
- Soil house when it cracks, because of moisture, we can keep adding the clay until the cracks stop.
- There is no fixed recipe wihthin Sand + Clay Combination
2. Bamboo
- Putting oil inside in Bamboo is the best (~~why?~~)
- Borax? Boric Acid
- Smoke 
3. Wood
- Wood vinegar? Water : Wood Vinergar = 10 Cubic( 10,000 L ) : 50 L = 200 L : 1 L
- Sand + Salt Water covering for the buried(30cm) part prevents terminate eating and damaging.
- Eucaliptuce lasts long.
- Soft wood would be just broken when times goes far.
- Thick Wood is Medium Hardy Wood.
4. Sand
5. Stone
6. Leaves

: Abudance with same tribe, Dream Together, Work Together, Enjoy Together.
Getting Inspired from each other, Establishing a system in Housing, Food Producing.
Love.

# Meaning of Happiness

Definite vision for life,
