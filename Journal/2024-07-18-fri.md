It would be great also how we can just adjust the permaculture principle for a site.
we could make much better of whole those process. we could learn from others but, also we can just plan it help to work it well.

but yes we feel so tired.
yeah. why this should be super difficult?
yeah. Tiring.

I would like to just rest in this place?
should I have to purchase flight ticket to some country? yes
vietnam can be better?
yes because this place seems not easy to keep staying here.

Vietnam would be the best place? or Nepal would be the best place?
we don't know, yeah but we'd like to know somewhere else some place good for us.

Happy that we could move onto the ChiangMai, and looking forward the Malaysia's Projects.
I feel tired with ... looking up a lot of places.
yeah.
