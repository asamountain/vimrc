very tiring. because last night we almost tried to understand each other.
we had a talk a lot.
it was difficult to understand her. yeah but I also finally understood about her.
she just wants to be heard. and she just wanted to feel safe. Just yelling or screaming doesn't work.
needed to explain the feeling.

she got better after when I assure I'd like to try explain my feeling no matter what would I feel.
