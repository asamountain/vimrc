time is fast.
I helped Pop today a lot.
helping for his works to carry all the soil bags from his parents house.

I feel more like my moments well.
whether that would be physically difficult or what,
just it makes me keep thinking 'all moments suppose to be given for my own benefit, maybe the giver is the universe, the only choice I could make myself is just accepting whatever I feel and I take'
'then the only right way, <Growth> will just happen. and it will complete my journey and bring me the place where I need to belong.'

this makes me so happy to go.
those things what I do these days, aren't super difficult, actually.
all those things I could handle well.

# If there is no other, there is no me. they are the part of my life as well.

I appreciate those moments.
still I have some budget to handle my financial condition, still I have some potentials and hopeful options with my country side settling down page.
I feel appreciate those hopes, and encounters with those friends.
they care the people well. 'they are the part of my life. how can I think about my life without them? if there is no presence of others, there is no <me> too'

yes this, her insight was super strong. of course, radically i could think or end up that mind. but just realizing how she met this insight within her life, throughout her way of treating her friends, the observation itself makes me feel the philosophy throughout my skin. this is one of huge realization.

to be honest, I wasn't think about that is super important those encountered people in my life.
the chance that we could encounter each other is super super unique chance, when it compares with the rate of universe of time. how could we imagine about the encountering chance that we meet each other at this century, at this place, at this moment, at this dimension, at this planet, at this universe as humans.

this is super important. and the rate of their coming for our farm, is super special as well. maybe the sailze also just a human word, but the other option of way to express it would be 'appreciation'. How could we imagine we could meet this moment as a customer who would like to buy our farm's service? that is beautiful universe's opportunity and miraclous concidence.
what can I say more about this?

yeah. I feel appreciate what I got learned from this farm. appropriately, I should deliver this speaking for them. I'd like to upload her talking about this 'friendship' or 'relationship' philosophy behind all their actions.
they are beautiful couple, human beings to care of this moment.

I'm appreciating them so much.
so what should I write down more of...
my thought?

I am struggling to make my own chances and abundunces into 10 times multiplied. how can I do that? and why should I do that? hm... because I want to learn more, earn more, sharing more, bigger more, stronger more. why? that is my just true nature. simple nature.

but how I could do that more efficiently? I want to even get faster for my growth?
just sleep well first.
and.. yeah that's it!
