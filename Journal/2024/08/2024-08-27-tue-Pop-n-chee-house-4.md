yeah It's a bit tiring.
I just don't want to do anything why?
I don't know...
just laziness makes myself tired.

I need to do something for myself.
it seems like, this place needs nothing to do for me.

of course, this afternoon or later, I would be there with them.

would I like it?
yeah. hellya yes! 
I want to see them.

but also, I worry about Mary, if we get distant, so we get byebye for each other.
permanently. yeah so that makes me feeling a bit sad.
but if that is happening, what could I do for it?
just I should live my life forward with what can I do my best. right?

hella yes.

then what would be the choice for my life and the other people?
keep updating the video can be the good things for us.
what kind of video? yeah video is pretty good.
but also I want to improve my productive mindset.
I want to be productive and creating something beautifully.

but seems not easy.

at first, it seems we need to figure out...
time line or time table things.

yeah that seems important.
but yeah. if we give a trial, it would be take more time of it.
of course, Goheung, We gonna having a time to understand about this.
my gf Mary, as a USA citizen.

yeah. but I need fast-rising like this? it's better to take time get slower, and have a look all of it.
right.
yeah but staying in the place seems great as well.
california.
maybe she needs the place for it. not me?
I don't know how it will unfold with this.


I feel but a bit sad.
how can I just being naturally drousy here.
I want to work out more, and meditate more.
and the being better version of myself does matter.

then how can I be that one?
meditation can be great for it.
yeah
life...
having a grip of myself seems difficult sometimes.
yeah.

**distraction free does matter.**
how can i make it?
what makes distraction exactly?
Internet? yeah. Internet distracts me so much.
the adult webtoon things. why is that?

because they are designed to attract us well.

an emotion which is unable to digest.
so I don't want to be with them.
but also I understand... yeah no body doesn't want to be with someone who think that.

when I think about the meeting, I feel disgusting about it so much.
so I do want to execute my own thing, but I should understand, if I couldn't grip myself up, wherever I go, that won't be successful.
so I must take care of my emotion first.

so what do I feel? do I want to be avoid it?
yeah. because I don't want to be with liar, and who willing to make someone as a liar.

why? because they just made me funny guy.
but we also did some good memory building.
they helped me to having my driver licence as well.
they gave me the chance to film their process. so it helped me to learn about permaculture and the others.

yeah. because there is a good side.
I feel appreciate of them.
I wish their rich.
I wish their happiness.
I wish their success.
that's what I want

let's leaving the message I left for battmung before

멍프렌즈 산이
멋진 글을 써주었다.
.
.
.
퍼머컬처 농장 밭멍을 지키고 계신 지현님을 만나면서, 같은 꿈을 꾸고 있음을 알았습니다.

퍼머컬처 생태마을을 갖거나 혹은 그런 생태마을의 일부가 되는 꿈을 말이죠.

밭멍을 이끄는 지현님은 이 꿈을 향해 곧장 나아가고 계시는 분입니다.

퍼머컬처 생태마을을 만들고 싶다던 이 분의 꿈을 들었을 때, 나비 한 마리가 날아온 듯 마음이 설레고 꿈틀꿈틀 했습니다.

장 지오노의 애니메이션 '나무를 심은 사람(The Man Who Planted Trees)'처럼 살고 싶다던 제 꿈처럼, 함께하는 분들과 퍼머컬쳐를 해나가며 이 꿈을 '함께' 이뤄나간다면 정말 행복하겠지요. 같은 꿈을 가진 사람들과 함께 한다는건 정말 가슴 부푸는 일입니다.

아마 온갖 다양한 자연이 가득한 공간이 될 수 있겠지요.

퍼머컬처로 마을 공동체를 이뤄 지속가능한 영향력을 사회에 퍼뜨리려 노력하는 퍼미들(퍼머컬처 디자이너들)은 아직 소수입니다. 지속가능한 사회를 퍼머컬처로 이루어가고 싶어하는 이 같은 꿈들이 현실이 된다면, 많은 사람들이 물질적인 욕망만을 좇아 사는 삶 속에서 얼마나 많은 기쁨과 행복을 누리며 살아갈 수 있을까 혼자 생각해봅니다.

자연적이고 지속가능한 방법으로 자연을 일구는 일은 우리가 반드시 선택해야만 하는 길 입니다만, 용기 있게 이 선택을 실천으로 밀고 나가는 사람은 여전히 부족하고, 주류가 아닌 탓에 정부 지원을 받기도 어려워 가시밭길, 자갈밭길처럼 묵묵히 걸어가기에는 힘들기만 합니다. 우리 나라의 대다수는 아직도 단일 작물로만 땅을 일구는 농법이 너무도 당연하게 이루어지고 있는 게 사실이니까요.

퍼머컬처를 한다하면 '그게 무슨 말도 안되는 소리야?'라며 어르신들과 공무원분들에게 욕먹거나 무시당하기 일쑤입니다.

하지만 밭멍의 지현님은 회사를 나와 지구의 모든 생명체를 풍요롭게 만드는 이 퍼머컬처를 하기 위해 직접 농장 만들었고, 키워나가고 있습니다. 사람들이 미쳤다고 말했을 때, '옳다'고 믿는 길을 묵묵히 따르겠노라 걷는 그 걸음이 절대 쉽지 않았겠지요.

'대한민국'이라는 자갈밭과 관행농법만이 주류를 이루는 이 같은 황량한 땅을 생태계와 자연의 올바른 질서로 다시 바로 잡아나갈 더 많은 용기 있는 자들이 필요하다는 생각이 듭니다.

저 역시도 그런 올바른 흐름에 일부가 되어, 올바른 일을 하며 살아가고 싶은 생각이 들고

스스로에게 부끄러움이 없이,

이 세상의 모든 생명체가 '진정한 풍요'를 얻으며 살아가길 진심으로 바라게 됩니다.

퍼머컬처는 그를 위한 선택이기도 하고요.

시골은 젊은 사람들에게는 기회의 땅입니다.

퍼머컬처는 황량한 곳을 생명으로 살찌울 수 있는 가장 자연스러우면서도 아름다운 방법이고.

이 퍼머컬처로 시골에서 기회를 만든다면

먹거리 문제, 환경 문제, 내 자신의 미래에 대한 문제, 경쟁이 아닌 협동과 서로 다름에서 오는 시너지로 얻게 될 행복들을 얻으며 분명 눈에 보이는 숫자보다 더 행복한 삶을 가꿔나갈 수 있을거라 생각합니다.

요 며칠 밭멍에 있으면서 그 같은 바람들이 실제로 이루어질 수 있을거라는 희망을 피부로 느껴가고 있기도 하고.

퍼머컬처가 가진 비전을 보고, 함께 그려나갈 사람들이 많아지면 좋겠습니다.🌳

한 사람이 한 그루의 나무처럼 서로 모여,
건강한 숲과 생태계를 만들었으면 좋겠습니다. 

---

so what is my option to go?
yeah what do I want to establish, what kind of life do I want to establish for my world?
yeah. that's it baby. that's it my boy.
you need to keep going whatever that happen. just keep moving, keep going. that is the what you need to do.


yeah. I understand. just what I need to do is, keep making and sharing what I learned from this journey, and keep growing up from it.
how to keep growing from it?
just share it what I learned from this journey.

that is just what I need to do.
I need to deliver my words and motivation with people. that is the first thing that I should need to do.

---

my dream?
yes I want to write down my dream...?
I want to have my own farm in a comfortable place.
I want to enjoy, and I want to feel there as a home.
peaceful home. without any worry.
just want to stay there with my gf.
and being happy without any worry.

yeah.
peace.
internal peace is super important.
peace...

how can I make the peace?
why I want to make the peace?
If I have it, wherever I go, there would be peace.
yes. the attatchment of desire, you want to be with her,
it makes the suffering. right?
**yeah. but I don't want to just throw everything away, but win from this consumerismic life style.**

how can I do that?
yeah permaculture, self-sufficiency does matter.
potatoes, corns, rices, tropical fruits. kakao, coconuts, yeah.
I want to do that.
how can I just simply do that?
they need to be grown.

yeah.
how can I make it?
just going to the South Korea? and start the farm directly? yeah that can be an option.
she can just come after all the plan. right?
yeah. that would be the place.

but where to stay in Goheung?
ha...
yeah it seems tiring...?
but we can give it a try
but where to stay in the Goheung?
Would we love it?
nope.
Rather Penang seems much better for it?
nope.

No place for us?
yeah.
but what kind of place do I really want?
Penang?
Pop n Chee's Community?
Should we just settling down here?

nope..
why? because I don't really know where to go for the next?
why?
hm...
yeah that seems the problem?
or I just need to having a talk with her.
yeah.


what would like to do if I die soon?
I would like to meet her
and being with her until my death
no matter what or how things would happen,
I would be just with her.
yeah
and die from her embrace.

yeah.
I love so much her.
I feel so crazy about her.
then should I just come over her place?
maybe that would be the best option to go?

I don't want to live anymore.
because... it seems ... very useless..
why I feel in this way?
because, it seems everything is meaningless.
Would the family love me?
I don't know.
I don't want to understand about it.
yeah. they won't like me if I don't offer something visionable result.
yeah.
so there is no retreat.
but only go and success.
yeah as long as I learned this thing.
I should return to Korea and start the farm thing.

and make it succeeded.
Than I can make others proud who supported me, and my family too.
Am I obsessed with those things?
nope. just I don't want to those kinds of life.
yeah If I understand what I don't like to have or to experience, I can understand myself well.
direction. yes direction is important.

of course it doesn't mean my decision will make an option but, yes my willingness, whatever it would unfold front of me, I can just keep going on. right?

yeah.
the process, the steps do matter more than any other things.
then I need to understand about the permaculture or whatever it does.
should I have to start from zero?
yeah probably.
but I'd like to have my own land to be honest.
no matter how much I go to mess up, it doesn't matter.

and probably, she won't be super happy from this situation.
because seems a bit lost.
we need to figure out the next step?
yes probably, but... the more I do think about our situation...
it's better to just go for the Goheung?
yeah we can slowly start about this job.

Why I should choose the Goheung?
because, there is a tropical place.
we'd like to having our own place.
we'd like to invite people.
we'd like to enjoy a place as other hosts.

yeah. but I want this.
yeah. but I don't know what would happen for her now..

Is she having some time with others..? or..
but whatever happens... would it matter for me?
can I stop to happen it?
nope.

nothing I can just stop it.
yeah. so what I can do is, just dreaming what I can dream for myself as a best.
what would be the best for me?
just visit her? maybe it can be a chance for this
but...
whatelse I can do after that?
meaningless...
maybe there is no way to get together with her again...?
yeah?

or... who knows there is a still way of it?
yeah?
I don't really know about it.
to be honest, I am about giving up on her.

yeah.
because, what can I do for her?
having a land?
having a something?

should I just move onto the USA?
what will happen next?
should I ask for their permission to having her?

what can I do for her?
yeah.
I should bring her better land,
better strategy
better options for her.
but...
Am I?

She told me she is the one, she wants to be with me.
That was special and lovely adorable decision.
I want to be with her as well.
I want to be with her until my end of my life.

how can I make it?
**how can I be with her as long as the very end of our life?**

1. trust her.
that is first.
no matter what happens, trust her first.

yeah 
2. and do your best.
my best. mediation, sleep properly, make some idea, keep thinking about the whole plan...etc...
they are the way to go.
I need to figure out all of those things?

hm... probably.
but how??
should I keep thinking about this?
or should I have to keep making anything like this?
