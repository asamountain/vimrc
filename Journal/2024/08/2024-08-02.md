tired..

yes. I want to sleep more. because last work was super difficult.
currently, I'm in the house of Shirin.
she is nice. but my ability to help her seems not sure that would match her needs.

speed is decent.
yes this house 100mbs and 40mbs per upload.
which is great.

yeah there are a lot of things we should have to concern.

Mars. I'd like to be there and a little wild we should have to visit them and learn something.
if we can move on another place as a learning place, that would be great.
but Mary would be in Singapore.

Should I follow her? would it make change?

I don't know. yes It would be great if I could make something from America. I'd be glad for it.
but without her support, I don't think that would be easier and legal.
yes. I'd like to have that partner visa but, if she is not willing to do that, I am not sure whether I should get there or not.
of course, either way, would it be better if I just go there.
but, I don't want to waste my money.
my parents help, I don't want to ignore it.

yeah.
so nither not easy to choose.
yeah but I can stay in MARS projects as well.
keep learning about those techniques, and learning about permaculture more.
I can contribute more about them too.
