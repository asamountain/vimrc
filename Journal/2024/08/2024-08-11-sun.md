maybe I should change the destination after something.
I'd love to know about life.
I'd love to understand about house, how to make it greater.

yeah everything seems not easy. but only one thing I can so sure is, whatever it just goes on outside of my inside, I can just observe it.
I can just have a look of it, and take a chance to see and to read what's going on with my emotions.
when I can properly observe my emotion, I can vibrate in a good rythms.

yes.
**so focus on my feeling whatever outside happening does really matter.**
I learn this so hard.

maybe the universe teaches me this for this timing, throughout this life.
but yeah also I would like to choose a good attitude or a good behave for it, but I don't understand what is the best decision for it?
just observe is the best way of it right?
yes.
