Left by Workawayer (Flore) for host
It was my first experience as a volonteer and I will never forget it.

I help Suha and Ogun for the fondation of the wood house and I will come back for sure for the end of the build.

Don't think and just go help them, they are friendly, easygoing, fun but worker.

Thank you for everything and see you in march ;)
