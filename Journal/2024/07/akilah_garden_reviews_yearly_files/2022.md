Isabelle stayed with us about 2 weeks, we couldn't have a good start as I was delaying her date, but she still came and I am really glad to meet her. We worked together, cook together and spent lots of times exploring around our village. Even some crazy parties with spiders and sochus :))
She is a responsible person and always was there whenever I asked for help. I definitely recommend her to all other hosts.
See you again Isabelle.

I just left the farm yesterday, it felt a bit like leaving home! I had such a good time with our host Suha, his son Alaz, the other volunteers and the animals. We worked a little bit, like building a platform for watching the stars (which we did!), planting some new vegetables in the garden and fixing the bench for the fireplace. We also cooked fresh vegetables and delicious things every day. But most amazing was that Suha would take us hiking, rock climbing, swimming, to caves, to a restaurant.. We did so many things and time went by so fast!! Also we did a couple of parties with dancing and singing I loved it!

Suha thank you so much for hosting me, you are so generous and I will miss you, the farm and animals. Next time I come back make a business with 20 baht for my house to sleep and party with little 8 paw furry friends ;)

I'll be back!

It was amazing to welcome Millie and Olivia for 2 weeks in my farm. They are both amazing souls and brought so much fun and life here. We built a room together, worked in the farm, and so many other little works we did together. They were always ready to help me whenever i needed. Millie always wants to work more even after we finish all the daily work and Olivia is a real star in the kitchen. We ate so many delicious meals together with all other volunteers.
Besides all the work it was amazing to get to know them and spend some time on hiking , rock climbing , making little journeys around the local areas.
I definitely recommend them to all other workaway hosts.

This was our first ever workaway experience and it was unforgettable! We stayed for 2 weeks and had such an amazing time. It is such a peaceful place and Suha has definitely found the balance between working hard and relaxing. Suha has such a big heart and is always going out of his way making sure that all of the volunteers are having a good time - we had so many laughs! We were able to do lots of activities outside of the farm work such as hiking, rock climbing, visiting hot springs, caves, the lake and the museum. Millie's highlights were spending time with Suhas boy Alaz and getting hands on with the building work and Olivia enjoyed going to the local food markets and cooking with fresh ingredients every day. We both felt like we learnt so much from Suha who is incredibly skilled at what he does. We are so grateful for our time at the farm, it really is such a special place and we will definitely be back!
Love from Millie and Oli <3

Suha made my first workaway experience a very positive one. He is a person who likes to share: what he has created on his little farm ( which is amazing), share his passion for rock- climbing, for cooking 3 times a day with heaps of fresh vegetables, for Thailand in general. He is so generous and kind and wants everybody on the farm feel good. The mood in the groups ( which were changing while I was there due to some who left and some newcomers) was lovely, everybody felt part if it immediately. I didn' t only meet an amazing host but also wonderful people from all kinds of countries. It felt like 3 weeks although it was only 8 days for me. I felt like leaving a family, isn' t that amazing after a few days...

I spent two weeks in Suha's farm and had a wonderful experience. Suha is a very special and interesting guy. He cares a lot about the volunteers in the farm, makes sure we always have enough food and asked for feedback and if everything is going well every couple of days.
With Suha and the other volunteers we had a little community, Shared great moments of rock climbing, traveling around, going to a festival, movie nights, bonfire, drinking, eating and having fun.
The work in the farm is quite chill and fun (sometimes physical) and you can learn all kinds of different things from Suha. We were building a room, cutting bamboo, harvesting, gardening and cooking different foods. We always had fresh fruits from the garden or the market, and all the ingredients we wanted in order to cook whatever was on our mind. You will not stay hungry in the farm for sure.
The farm was a great place to relex in the nature with Susam the cutest dog, the two cats, the chickens and the other volunteers.
Thank you Suha for the great time and experience (:

I spent two wonderful weeks on Suha's farm. We went rock climbing, to festivals, had time to relax in this beautiful nature and I was surrounded by a very nice community. The work consisted of weeding, work on the new house, cutting bamboo and watering the plans. We always cooked the meals together, had lots of fresh fruits like papaya, which we could harvest ourself, and just had a great time. Suha is a wonderful person, always looks out for everyone and you can learn a lot from him. I highly recommend staying there! I will miss this place and hope to come back.

I stayed with Suha for about 8 days and in that time we: worked on a shed, on the road, cooked, climbed, hiked, biked, met some very interesting friends of his, lived through an earthquake, did yoga, learned about thai herbal medicine, saw a wide array of insects (the biodiversity there is bananas) and all of this while still having the time and space to work on my remote job. Time passes a bit differently in Suha's farm, and in a good way, the place has as many comforts as one can imagine having in the middle of nowhere, including water, electricity, western toilet, WiFi, and a 7-eleven within biking distance. About Suha himself, he is an incredibly open and kind, intelligent man, who also personally built most of what you see in the farm, and I am looking forward to seeing him again in the future.

Staying at Suha's was amazing. He made sure that we felt welcomed and at home as soon as he picked us up in Chiang Mai. His farm is beautiful and it's amazing to think that he built it all himself. The work is light and you have a lot of freedom to explore the area and there's a lot you can see! We went rock climbing, visited a local bar which was really fun (and random hahaha), we went to an art museum, a cave (with a temple inside) and there are also hot springs nearby! Suha is not only a really interesting person himself, but he also knows a lot of very interesting people who we had the pleasure to meet. It's really easy to talk to Suha when you have concerns about anything, it's really fun to talk to him and he knows quite a lot about farming and carpentry, all from volunteering himself! Sara and Alaz were there for a couple of days and we did morning yoga together, which was awesome, and Sara told us a little bit about different plants in the farm and their medicinal benefits which was really interesting. I truly feel like I now have a home in the east of Chiang Mai and can't wait to come back to visit when I'm in the area again. Thank you for everything Suha, see you soon! 🤍

To be honest, I cannot really describe my time at Suha’s farm. This was my second workaway experience and it was absolutely fantastic! :D Suha is such an open hearted, kind guy and I’ve definitely learned a lot from him. He taught us about plants and farming, took us to really cool places (we even went rock climbing a few times) and provided us with a loooot of gooood food.😋 Alaz, his son, is also really sweet and when he was around we often played some fun games with him. Suha really created an amazing place there and I will really miss the Farm and the amazing people I’ve met there. I’ll definitely come back someday!!🤎

The Workaway at organic farm was an amazing experience. The farm itself is in the middle of nature and everything is built of wood. I spent two weeks at the farm in february and because of the upcoming smokey season, there wasn't so much real farming to do, so we learned a lot about working with bamboo, composting,... As a rockclimber I especially loved this place because we got to spend so much time in the nearby rock climbing area. More than only the farm experience, these two weeks were also so interesting and enriching to live together with people of different nationalities, having a daily routine together, we cooked the best food, we did yoga, we explored the area, we got to learn about eachothers views on life during the long evening at the fire,... Suha is always doing his best to get everyone involved, make sure everyone has a good time, to teach a bunch of stuff, and just to spend time together. It was also very interesting for me to talk to Sara and get to know more about Thai Medicine and healing methods. And their son Alaz is the best!

It was one of the best things we experienced in Thailand. Sharing time with Suha and his lovely family was amazing. Really chill vibe, lots of climbing, great time cooking fresh and healthy food all of us together, taking time to observe nature (rain, soil, plants, animals, stars, moon, sun)... If we have to describe the whole experience, we should write a book about it. But just to highlight a few of what we carry in our memories with such a grateful feeling:
# Suha is such an enthusiastic climber, really willing to share what he knows and to make other people love this sport as much as he does (if you're already a climber or have an interest in learning it, I guess there's no better workaway in Thailand).
# Working there doesn't feel like working at all, it's always fun!!
# Nice chats around the fire!
# Alaz (the son) is sooo nice! I don't remember meeting such a thoughtful kid... We really liked sharing time with him.
# Sarah has an amazing peaceful vibe. Just talking to her made me much more aware of my tone of voice, how much I speak and how much I listen... She also knows a lot about plants for medicinal and nutritional ends.
If you're fortunate as we were, you will leave Mae On with friends for life <3 <3

Suha is an amazing host! He does his very best to comfort all his workawayers.
When I was at Suha's place, it was as close to the dry and smokey season, hence no work on the land. We had a lot of free time, which we spend cooking, reading and chatting at the terrace or Suha took us out on a climbing trip or to the lake for a swim. The climbing was really great! Wonderful rocks :)
We did work on some projects: we collected bamboo for a little house and a raft for the lake. We had a lot of freedom to complete the work.
I slept in the dorm, which was basic, but perfect. Sheets were clean and Suha asked me several times whether I needed something else. As we couldn't arrange a grab pickup, Suha took us to the village to take the bus from there.
Thanks a lot for your good care, Suha!

This workaway will stay in my memory and heart for a long time. I originally wanted to stay only a week, but I ended up staying more than a month, and I would go back again... I loved the farm from the first moment and knew it was the perfect place for me. Everyone accepted my bad-basic English and I stopped being shy to speak! I felt here like my second home.

Suha takes care of the volunteers like family and spends all his time with us. We were like a family! Going on hikes together, climbing, shopping at the street market, cooking and eating, working on the farm, yoga, watching movies, relaxing, talking around the fire and so much more. All the time together.

He taught us a lot and showed us new things. I have so many experiences. Suha's family son Alaz and wife Sara, are also amazing!

I went to the farm with that I was ready to work hard and I left having learned to really relax, enjoy just being, not planning, climbing and lots of first time experiences.
