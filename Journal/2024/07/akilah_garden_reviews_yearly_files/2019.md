Xioahan stayed in our farm around a week. And we were so glad to host her. Although it was the end of the year and holiday and resting time, we got some works done together. She was always ready when we need help. She took care of chickens and ducks everyday, helped some farmwork, woodwork and cooking all the time. Also i appreciate her time she spend with my son. They became good friends too.
I would definitely recommend Xioahan for all other hosts on workaway.
Hope to see you Xioahan one day again..

This is my first Workaway experience and I'm glad to say I enjoy every bit of it. Suha, Sara and Alaz are wonderful people and a lovely family. They're truly passionate about self-sufficiency, permaculture and organic farming and are eager to share the knowledge with anyone who's interested to learn. It's so impressive how everything in the farm is built from scratch and all systems run efficiently such that nothing is wasted.

Even though I arrived at a non-peak season, I still managed to help with some work: feeding chickens, planting seeds, carpentry, collecting firewood and cooking. Suha is a knowledgeable and caring host. I'm not experienced in farmwork at all but he patiently guided me, along with the volunteers for all the work we did.

On days we didn't work, we went hiking, local markets and just chilled around. I enjoyed paying with Alaz as well -- we practised Thai and watched cartoons together at the balcony of a hut in evenings.

Thank you for the wonderful time! I already miss you guys and hope to visit again. :)

Tessie and her wonderful daughter little Lari stayed in our farm during whole November. And we all have great time together. First of all Tessi is a great cook. And she cooked us amazing food for us every day. We also did many different work together outside the kitchen too. Planting seeds, transplanting the grown up plants, taking care of garden, animals, kids etc.. Also some wood&bamboo work. Besides the whole work we enjoyed our free times in the farm and outside too. Exploring caves, mountains, hot springs, or just sitting and enjoying slow life around the bon fire. Little girl Lari is also an amazing child, she is so calm and wise and happy all the time. We will miss this 2 beautiful beings..
And yes. I literally recommend Tessie and little Lari to all workaway hosts, who are in need of responsible, lovely volunteers..

This farm is a beautiful place that attracts beautiful people. It is the kind of place where everyone works together, cooks meals together, and debates who gets to do the dishes because everyone wants to keep helping. My 6 year old daughter and I stayed for a month and were made to feel so welcome. We made friends from around the world and everyone helped take care of my daughter with a willing spirit. Sara helped heal people with health ailments and Suha took us outside the farm for adventures like hiking, caves, hot springs and markets. We learned farming techniques and woodworking. This farm is the kind of place you never forget. I would absolutely recommend it! Thank you Suha and Sara for creating a place that can touch so many people positively.

My first workaway experience here was just brilliant! Suha and Sara are such welcoming and friendly people which helped me to immediately feel at home with them. Their son Alas is an absolute legend as well, make sure to ask him for a game or two of his choosing :)
I made some good friends as well in the other volunteers and we learnt a lot about permaculture, small scale organic farming and even a bit of wood and bamboo work! All the while eating incredibly fresh fruit and veg from the garden every day. I hope that the farm continues to grow and change and I am looking forward to returning in the future to see the progress! Thank you so much guys, all the best x

This was our first workaway experience and it couldn't have been any better. Suha & Sara are exceptionally caring and generous hosts, who made us feel at home from day one. During our three weeks with them we got to experience rural thai life, learned tons of new skills and made new friends from all over the world. We built a deck near the river, planted tons of Ocra and painted a building. Our highlights were the daily early morning Yoga sessions, the bamboo harvest (and furniture production), the trekking on the mountain and of course Suhas campfire stories. Good times.

I spent two weeks at Suha and Sara's and definitely recommend their farm. They're very welcoming and friendly and will make you feel at home straightaway. Make sure you are coming here looking for an experience that will put you out of your comfort zone - the accomodation was built by Suha and volunteers from scratch. The result is a comfortable and very peaceful place.
You won't get bored if you are willing to help, and will learn a lot about being resourceful in this kind of evironment.
Also there's a lot of coming and going which got me to meet a lot of people and knowing both moments of fun and relaxation.

This was my very first experience on Workaway and also on working on a farm abroad. And i can tell that I’m really happy that we got to know suah and Sara and their farm. Even when there wasn’t really something to to because of the dry season, nevertheless we learned so many things from them, things about farming, wood work, local Thai cooking, and self conscious living in terms of the environment. In addition to learning every day new things we were very free what to do. Going on a hike together, exploring the area around or just exchanging and having a great time with the people and other volunteers at the farm.
So in the end I would come back to this lovely place whenever I have the opportunity. Thanks Suah and Sara, for such a great experience!

I stayed 1 week with Suha, Sara and Alaz for my first workaway experience. The three of them were very friendly and generous people from whom I have learned a lot about organic farming but also about local meals, yoga, thai medicine...
The work at the farm was diverse and instructive, from gardening (weeding, watering, seeding...) to carpentry. During my free time, i visited nice places around by bike, played cards with the dynamic Alaz or simply relaxed in the farm.
I am highly impressed by this family who has succeeded in building this amazing place from scratch and in accordance with their environmental convictions. I am looking forward to return one day to see how the project evolves.
Thank you so much for this first experience and wish you all the best for the future.

They are very open and willing to share their knowledge to the volunteers. We learnt about permaculture, woodwork, biodynamics, Yoga, Thai herbal medicines and of course the making of papaya salad! I felt extra lucky to get to visit the Thai medicine school also!
The work we have done was watering the plants, feeding chickens, some woodwork, helping to make dinner etc.
It is a very nice family and they attract interesting travellers to the farm. I enjoyed playing with the energetic young man Alas also!

I stayed at Suha's and Sara's farm for a week in December and I had a great time!

The hospitality was great, i felt like visiting my family abroad. The hosts really care for their guests and make anything possible to make them feel at home. They also speak perfect English which makes the communication easy.
The farm is ideal to relax, enjoy nature and detox. I especially enjoyed the fresh air and jungle sounds while sleeping in the wooden house. There is also a lot of pure beautiful nature around to visit with the bicycle or bike.
The food is simple, healthy, vegeterian and mostly organic. Rice with vegetables and/or eggs is the usual meal for breakfast, lunch and dinner. For dessert I mostly had delicious bananas and papayas from the farm.
The work depends on what is needed and what the strengths of the volunteers are. It can be farm work, construction or cooking. I learned some things in all those three areas. It usually starts in the morning and lasts about 3-4 hours.

I definitely recommend a stay at this farm and hope to visit Suha, Sara and Alas soon again in the future.

We had a really good time staying with Suha and Sara at their wonderful permaculture farm. Despite the driest season of the year when there is not too much to be done, Suha took his time to explain to us about permaculture, plants, compost, chicken and sustainable living, while Sara taught us yoga, Thai massage, and medicinal plants.

When we had free time, we also had lot of fun with their son and other awesome fellow volunteers. We went hiking, shopped at the local market, cooked together, and enjoyed game nights. Saha and Sara are kind, patient, and loving.

We had great experience! Thank you Suha and Sara for having us. See you again next time.

This was my very first experience on a sustainable eco farm and I loved it. Suha is a very patient and lovely guy you can learn a lot from. He showed us woodworking, introduced us in farming and gave advice how to build a farm. He teaches with patience and pleasure, so it is also understandable for beginners. Outside the working times we had many communal activities, such as cooking, daytours to the mountain and cave, lessons about massage and biodynamics and the yoga practice by his competent and sympathetic wife Sara. Moreover both care that the harmony in the group is maintained. They put much emphasis on talking in case there is any problem (but there has never been one). Everyone respects each other. Overall, this project is more than just a place to work at. It is a familiar community in which you can learn a lot for your life. I am thankful for being there and I hope once I can return to this wonderful place! You'll stay in my heart and in my mind!

First of all sorry Suha for the delay! Being at Suha's place was an amazing experience. In fact it was our first time in a permaculture farm and we learned a lot! We needed just ten minutes to feel like home as you can feel the love and the beautiful energy Suha and the past volunteer invested in this place. Despite the dry season we always found something to do. Working with the soil, building furniture was so much fun, exhausting but in a good way as you can see in the end of the day that it was all worth it, so rewarding and inspiring.
Thank you Suha, Sarah and Alas.Thank you to the other volunteers who felt like family. We hope that you enjoyed your deserved holidays and that we will come again.

Work wasn't hard, mostly taking care of the plants and chickens, planting seeds and transplanting, sometimes digging some holes - if someone was okay with this. Volunteers have either private or shared rooms, there's a lot privacy and it's comfortable. Food is always fresh and great, Sara makes the best natural yogurt ever!

I had the most amazing time staying with Suha, Sarah and Alaz at this beautiful permaculture farm! As soon as I arrived I felt welcomed by everyone. The farm is surrounded by mountains, trees and natural beauty. It also attracts many interesting and cool volunteers. I really enjoyed spending time each night by the campfire and talking with Suha, Sarah, and the other volunteers. It felt like home away from home! I also had a lot of fun hanging out with Alaz, their 7-year old son! He taught me some cool dance moves. Suha is an awesome host who is very helpful and knowledgeable about many topics, including building and permaculture. We had a lot of fun together! Sarah is an incredible yoga teacher who led amazing classes every morning. I loved waking up to her calming voice! She is an excellent teacher and is also very knowledgeable about Thai medicine. Both Sarah and Suha gave me plenty of advice when I wanted to go to the caves, hot springs and museum near by. All of these attractions were amazing and accessible on the bicycle they have. If you’re looking to escape from the city and see some nature in a laid back and friendly environment, this is the perfect place to go. I hope to come back to visit Suha, Sarah, and Alaz again!

I stayed with Suha, Sara and Alaz for almost 2 weeks , but it definitely wasn't enough for me.
I learned a lot from Suha about gardening, building, composting, permaculture and even cooking :)
In the farm the days started with yoga. (thanks to Sara) After yoga we cared the chickens and watered the seeds and then had breakfast together. In the evenings the work is watering the garden and caring the chickens again. These are the routine works. Other than these we did some building , planting, composting, transplanting the seeds, harvesting, cleaning. I did all the work happily and with passion, I wish I could give them more, but it was my first workaway experience and I'm just starting to learn about working in a farm.
Besides work one day Suha took all of us for climbing and hiking to a mountain. It was one of my best experiences. A couple of days he took us to the noodle shop and to a nearby local bar. Also every week we go to the local market twice and buy some delicious vegetables. We always cooked our food together and in the evenings we made a fire and chat around it. You can see lots of stars at night and it was amazing. I never wanted to leave there and still missing that farm so much.
There are so much places to visit nearby , like caves, hot springs, etc. that you can go on your day offs. Because I don't know how to ride a bicycle , Suha even dropped us to the cave with his car. If you choose to stay in the farm on your day offs, it is also really fun and peaceful. You can always play with the cute dog Susam and 2 cats Ayu and Kara. On weekends I sometimes played lego with Alaz and it was so much fun.
Actually we did so many other things together and I miss all of them. This farm made me change in a good way and I'm thankful to them for these changes. I hope I can come again soon.

8 days just passed so fast like an arrow. I am so grateful for having the opportunity to be involved in this farm, that experience was priceless. Even i had no related experience or good knowledge in this field, i was welcomed. We built the frame for chicken house, from digging the soil to building the roof, didn't even spent two days to finish. Also we did some rocks filling to the muddy road outside of the farm house.

Suha was always willing to teach us and answer our questions all the time. He's easygoing and caring to the volunteers. I could totally feel his enthusiasm and persistence on living a sustainable life and conserve the environment,also very conscious of what the world is going on. What he shared to us was inspiring. He's chill but wild on driving his motorbike XD Also Sara, she made us feel like home and comfortable all the time, always share a lot of her knowledge on herbs, health etc, to us. i real appreciate their spirits and energy.You could feel a genuine interaction between human being with them. They are a family full of positive energy and it's contagious because they shared. And what i have learned during the stay definitely benefit me for life!

We are so thankful for this wonderful experience and the opportunity to meet this inspirational family. Suha and Sara were so welcoming and we felt right at home very quickly. Their son, Alaz, is a sweet and energetic 6 year old who loves to play games...checkers, uno, and 3 rocks! Suha and Sara genuinely care about nature, stewarding the land and minimizing their impact to the earth. Suha is easygoing and is more than willing to share his knowledge of permaculture and the process of creating an organic farm from a former GMO corn field. Sara has a wealth of knowledge about medicinal herbs and plants. She taught us a number of plants and their uses; we even got to put them into practice. For example: after a night of drinking we made "hangover tea" from Laurel Clock Vine and rice and learned how to use the leaves of a local plant to stop the bleeding from a leech bite. In the mornings Sara would teach a wonderful yoga class, which was such a perfect way to start the day. The farm work was interesting and enjoyable and included planting herbs, feeding the chickens and ducks, watering the garden, building a new raised garden bed and helping a little with the construction of a new dormitory. We enjoyed cooking many shared healthy meals and spending the evenings hanging out together on the outdoor yoga sala. Thank you Suha, Sara and Alaz for sharing your beautiful home with us and teaching us so much! We hope we can come back and stay longer next time :)

After landing in Bangkok, I moved straight away from this big city to join Suha and Sara’s project in the west of Chiang Mai.
After almost 3 days of traveling, they welcomed me warmly and in my little bamboo house I was feeling like home.
4 others workawayers was already there and very fast I was feeling a member of the team.
Suha and Sara have a big knowlege in medicinal remedy with natural plants they grow in their garden.
And they also teached me many Thaï recepy especially the succulent papaya salad, not so easy to prepare, more like 1h of bodybuilding for your arms!
I also chose this workaway because Suha is a climber and they live just 4km away from Crazy Horse. We went climbing 2 times, the spot HeartWall is beautiful, full of monkeys !
I recommend Sara and Suha’s project to all volunteers!

Alisha stayed with us more than a month.And i cant find words to tell about her.She is also the one who stayed longest in our farm.After a week she got good skills in farm work ,animal care, building works and helping us taking care our boy . And her help all in those tasks were really amazing . She also show how to do different works to short term volunteers . And this also ease our chores in the farm.Besides all, we became really good friends, and spend many times talking enjoying hiking exploring around.We still keep in contact . So I am sure that she will visit us one day again.
Alisha you have a second home in Chiang Mai ,forever ..

I spent a bit more than one month on this wonderful farm and feel grateful about every day I stayed there!
I learned a lot about gardening and especially building with wood!
It’s amazing to see the process of the farm and to be part of making the ideas come true..
Also the food was really, really good and the fridge is always full with vegetables and fruits!
There are so many things I could write more about f. e playing with Alaz, climbing the nearby mountain, visiting the art museum or the many beautiful bonfires we made but I think everyone who is visiting Chiang Mai and wants to have an unforgettable time outside of the super touristic places should just apply and explore the farm and the many things to do around it by themselves :)

Thank you for everything Suha, Sara and of course Alaz and I hope to visit you again soon! And please take care of the bamboo and the chicken haha
Lots of love to everyone and all the animals

We stayed one week with Süha, Sara and Alaz and we had a wonderful time !
You will be able to learn a lot about permaculture while getting your hands dirty in the garden, be part of the construction project and do wood working (cleaning, cutting, nailing it...) !
The food is just awesome, fresh vegetables and fruits in the fridge to eat whenever you want.
There were really good vibes with the other workawayers, we cooked every meal together, visited the area, shared a drinks around the bonfire at night...
Also, start to train playing checker, you will have to play with Alaz and he's quite good. You will also need to pet one adorable dog and two cats :)
Our only regret is that we couldn't stay more !
Thanks you for everything, if we come back to north Thailand, we will definitely come to see you again !

Martin and Karen stayed with us for two weeks and were very helpful and enjoyable. They both helped any time work needed to be done which was pulling weeds, doing dishes, preparing meals for everyone, and helping on construction of our new building. Karen had a garden before so is good with farming skills. She was working hard all of the time with planting new seedlings, making vegetable beds, watering and helped with the animals. Martin worked mostly on the new building and we put up the walls and steps and did the framing to keep the rain out. We had other workawayers here and everyone was like family. They helped play with our 6 year-old boy and especially Martin did while he was here. They were very good with all their skills and I would definitely recommend them to all other hosts who need work.Hope to see them again in our farm one day..

We stayed with Suha, Sara, and Alaz for two weeks and had a great time working on their organic farm and helping them build a new guest house for others who will be staying there in the future. We ate three generous vegetarian meals a day with much of the fruit and produce picked from their garden and they took us around to the local markets, a museum, nearby restaurants for lunch and took us hiking on two different occasions. Additionally, Sara led us all through yoga every morning. The rooms were primitive but sufficient and private and the showers only had cold water, but after working on a hot day it was refreshing. They can house up to six workawayers and are building another guest house so you are always having interesting conversations with people from other countries. If you are in the Chiang Mai area and are interested in learning about permaculture farming, we would recommend you stay here.
