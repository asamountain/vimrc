The 10 days I spent at the farm were simply amazing. It was definitly too short.

This is the best workaway experience I ever had (3rd one). Suha and Millie were so nice and really helped me to feel like home.
Just to warn you: if you like boring people this place is not for you ... Suha is such an amazing lovely character (a little bit crazy and that's why we love him ahah).

The work was really chill. A few hours per week and the rest of the time you can do whatever you want with other volunteers or alone. This place is perfect for someone who looks for going back to the essential things of life: chilling, meditating, sport (rockclimbing / yoga / hiking), cooking and spending time with amazing people.

Thank you Suha and Millie for everything ‚ù§Ô∏è

We would recommend this driven and fun couple to all workaway hosts! They are both very knowledgeable as well as willing to learn. We harvested and split bamboo, created a wooden frame for a new room, planted and gardened and they got stuck in with all of it with a positive attitude. Matthieu even created his own bamboo project which we will continue to use! thank you very much, you will always be a part of our farm :)

Our volunteering at Akirah‚Äôs garden with Suha & Millie was amazing. We stayed there for 2 weeks and it was an experience we will remember forever. We wished we could have stayed longer but we had to leave because of our visa.

From the moment we arrived, we felt very welcome and at home. This farm is a green, relaxing and convivial place.
Our work consisted of cooking together, maintaining the garden and building things out of wood and bamboo.

The farm is also well located, just a 45-minute bus ride from Chiang Mai. There are many activities available in the surrounding area, some of them organised by Suha: cliff climbing (1 or 2 times a week), hiking, cave visits, caf√©s, market, art gallery, etc.

Suha & Millie are very caring and dedicated to their volunteers. For example, they introduce beginners to climbing with a lot of patience and kindness. They also adapt the activities to the group's preferences.

Finally, the other volunteers (around ten young people) contributed greatly to this incredible experience.
Thank you, dear friends, for everything!

It was a delight welcoming Hannah and Aston to the garden. They are a positive and fun couple who are always eager to learn and ready to lend a hand. They were very helpful with harvesting bamboo, planting seeds and with woodwork. They fit right here and would highly recommend them to other hosts. Thank you for your help, you've left an impact on the farm :)

Me and my girlfriend came to this place for a couple of weeks without really knowing what to expect but it happened to be the best 2 weeks we have had in thailand so far. Suha and Millie were our hosts and they were fantastic, supplying us with all our food and accommodation with plenty of activities to keep us entertained. He told us to treat his farm like it was our own and we never felt more at home. He took us rock climbing all around the area and i learnt i lot from this experince as i have not done it before outside. I highly recomnmend staying here and i will definitly be back. Wish them all the best for the future.

Suha was so generous to us during our time with him and many other volunteers! My favorite part about staying with him was cooking and eating together with everyone everyday! We had such a cheap food allowance in return for amazing vegetarian meals together! He was so nice sharing all his climbing knowledge with us! If you are a volunteer looking to go here and have your own climbing gear you should bring it with you! Or if you have gear you don‚Äôt need anymore Suha could definitely use it! We were free to walk around or use his spare moto to get around. I was to scared to sit on the back of a moto so I would walk to the cacao farm nearby to get us all fresh coffee! There is also a super cool museum that you can walk to. But my favorite day was going on a hike up the mountain with Suha! The view was amazing and I felt so accomplished afterwards! We helped out with the garden too! I hope what we transplanted into the garden is still growing! Our room was right by the kitchen and main living space and we were able to use a fan from the living space at night in our room. We will miss swimming in the pond he made himself!
Suha thanks again and we hope to see you again one day!

I thoroughly loved my time on the farm, and would recommend to everyone (esp climbers!). Suha truly goes above and beyond for his volunteers, ensuring they get to make the most of their time spent with him. A great teacher on permaculture activities; harvesting bamboo, growing plants, upkeep of buildings etc, and super enthusiastic for all out of farm fun too! Can't wait to see Suha again soon

I am so happy to meet with amazing Emily. She is so lovely , positive, responsible and ready to help whenever i needed. Stayed here for 2 weeks. Farm was crowded when she arrive and as she wanted to stay longer i couldnt say no even i didnt have enough space. Because i wanted her to stay as long as possible.
With other volunteers together we did some farm work and many other farm routiunes. She is also very good at kitchen. Helped me a lot with cooking and cleaning. Annnndd i will never forget her chocolate brownies. they were the most delicious things i have ever eaten in this farm since the beginning of time :)
We also did some many other acrtivities . She was very good and strong during our rock climbing sessions and hiking to the mountain during this hard rainy season.
I definitely recommend her to all other workaway hosts.

My stay at S√ºha‚Äôs home was my highlight of Thailand! I was only meant to stay a week, and stayed two weeks (which still didn‚Äôt feel long enough). His farm is nestled at the foot of gorgeous mountains in the Mae On district, with incredible rockclimbing, hiking, lakes, and caves all accessible. S√ºha is a passionate mountaineer and climber himself, so he was eager to share this love with his volunteers, and helped teach rock climbing to any new enthusiasts.

As a team with the other Workawayers and S√ºha in the lead (he is an excellent chef!), we prepared delicious meals with the organic produce from both local markets and his garden. It was a wonderful way to learn to cook Thai (and Turkish fusion) food and get a feel for how locals live.

There is a real community vibe in his home, so be prepared to get stuck into cooking, cleaning, general maintenance, and helping in the garden. Take initiative and it will leave a lasting impression. Some of my favourite memories were the games other volunteers taught us, and the foods they prepared from their home country.

I made wonderful friends during my time there - likeminded, great people seem to be drawn to his Sanctury. üå±

S√ºha himself is an inspirational man who embodies the principles of living in the now, and treading lightly in the earth. He gracefully rejects the life of a wage-slave caught in the cycle of buying stuff that doesn't enrich living. I have learned a great deal from him (ranging from permaculture to Thailand to life in general), while also having so much fun! Thank you Suh√º!

I can‚Äôt recommend this opportunity highly enough! I hope to be back :)

S√ºha has created and is nurturing a peaceful oasis in the countryside. He is a fun, charismatic & kind character who has built a lovely space to relax and unwind in the company of new friends. I had a wonderful two week stay here and met a wonderful collection of beautiful people I‚Äôm sure to see again in the future!

S√ºha doesn‚Äôt expect much and the work is minimal, with no more than two hours on working days, which tended to be every second day. Each day we would wake up with yoga, cook together and make trips out to explore the area or head to the markets when we were not working. Activities outside work included climbing, hiking or heading to other places of interest such as the gallery, cave temples or his own lake for swimming. There is also bikes available to get around yourself and a close 7/11.

Thanks S√ºha for a wonderful experience, until next time ‚ú®

Suha is a funny, charismatic and endearing character. We extended our stay at his place for a total of almost 2 weeks. We spent most of the time chilling, practicing yoga in the morning, doing grosseries, cooking good food and more chilling. Suha had some things to sort out so the daily help was between none to 2 hours, which was perfectly fine for us by the way. He showed us around quite a lot to nice places as his lake, a huge Buddha cave and the cherry on the cake : to rock climbing ! He really passed us his passion for it and we had such good time doing it. We feel very blessed to have had the opportunity to learn about farming and climbing with such a nice person. Thank you Suha ! Hope to see you in a while üòÑ

We stayed at Suha's farm for a week and it was a great experience! He was very passionate about farming and was able to teach us some things, but there wasn't a lot of work to do, so we had a lot of free time. Additionally, we made many trips together and saw a lot of the surrounding of the farm and went rockclimbing with him, which was a lot of fun!
We are very thankful for this experience and wish him and his farm all the best.

I just wan to thank you to S√ºha one more time from here. I spend 3 amazing weeks in his farm and that was my one the best highlight of my trip. It was my first workaway experience and I think I would never guess that this can be better.

There is a beautiful environment in his farm and being part of it was amazing, the friendships that I made there were unforgettable.

One of the best things about the farm is the experiences that I had. He gave me a change to do lot of things for the first time, such as rock climbing and lake swimming.

Thank you for creating such a wonderful place for people to learn, grow and connect. I really appreciate the opportunity to be a part of your community, and I always will.

We stayed at Suha's farm for 2 weeks at the start of April. Despite the smoky season, our stay was incredibly enjoyable and fun. The farm is peaceful and relaxing, with plenty of things to do around the area. Suha is an active host which does plenty of things for his volunteers, showing them the area around, bringing them rock climbing, teaching how to cook delicious Thai meals, and creating an immense sense of community between the people at the farm. He's truly managed to create a magical place for everyone, and for our first workaway, this was an enchanting experience. We truly hope to return one day as friends, and be able to cultivate Suha's dream even further. Thank you for these amazing two weeks Suha!

Also, they gave the best yoga classes and meditation for the people here.
Amazing climbers for their first time on the rock, proving their energy and ability to learn fast.

S√ºha was simply the best host we could have asked for our first workaway experience.

He instantly made us feel at home from the moment we passed the gate. A genuinely knowledgeable and kind-hearted man, with crazy interesting stories to share. He was simply so much fun to spend time with and possibly one of the most caring people we've crossed paths with.

His farm is a true peace haven where we learned about permaculture while enjoying the soothing surrounding nature in rural Thailand. He hosted us in his cozy wooden farm with great rooms (and comfortable bed) and nice open community space, perfect for yoga in the mornings and hanging out in our free time.

The food was amazing and he taught us delicious recipes with farm fresh ingredients for every meal.

He was the best teacher to introduce us to rock climbing. His encouragement went a long way. He transmitted us his passion for the rocks. We are beyond grateful for this.

Bottom line is, we leave with a huge smile on our face and a little bit of melancholia in our heart, with great insights and inspiration for a more sustainable life.

Thank you so much S√ºha. We hope to see you again soon!

Amazing experience at Suha's farm. I enjoyed the rock climbing, the easiness of the farm and the healthy food we cooked every day very much. Our group of volunteers grew together so strong, even if all people were so different and unique. We even went to the shambala festival together, which was an amazing experience itself. I'd really recommend this farmstay to everyone who would like to experience an active, sporty and funny community feeling at a farm. And especially to rock climbers, because Suha will show you the best crags and routes of crazy horse, and if you need it, he always can help you out with a beta. 10/10, and I definitely want to come again!
