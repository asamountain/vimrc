Our 1 week workaway experience at Süha's farm was nothing short of extraordinary. Süha is not just a host; he's a passionate creator of community and unforgettable memories.

From the serene countryside setting to the variety of activities, Süha ensured we felt at home from day one. His contagious enthusiasm and genuine kindness made the experience truly special.

Süha goes beyond being a host; he's an adventurer, storyteller, and mentor. The days were filled with hiking, yoga, and learning about sustainable living through permaculture. The open community space became a hub for shared experiences and laughter.

What sets Süha apart is his commitment to creating a magical space for personal growth and connection. His farm is more than just a workplace; it's a canvas for shared adventures and camaraderie.

In conclusion, my time at Süha's farm was filled with gratitude and inspiration. Thank you, Süha, for being an exceptional host and creating a space where memories are made. Looking forward to returning for more adventures.

Best,
Laura&Bekir

We both miss Nikita so much already! She is a superstar - always on hand to help with a sparkling personality. She has brought so much energy and happiness to the farm and is always happy to get stuck in with work. She was amazing working with bamboo, cooking in the kitchen, gardening and we were able to trust her to do daily tasks such as watering the garden every day. We totally recommend Nikita to everyone - she is a rare find :)

I really enjoyed staying with Millie and Suha at their farm. I spent two weeks on the project in December. They taught me a lot and know a lot about Thai culture and the neighborhood. If I had time, I would have stayed at least twice as long. Near the farm there are beautiful places where you can go when you don't have to work. To conclude, a big thank you for taking us on your mountain climbing trips. a new passion has arisen here. Good luck and have fun on your farm! Big hug, Nikita
