It seems interesting, how she can be so important for my journey forward.
yeah. I want to be her supporter, I want to be the one she can lean on.

why? because I want to be the one throughout her leaning on.
I may want to realize my value or importancy for my life, throughout her existance. yes what an attachment. I don't have to treat mygf as a tool.
my love is just a lover. I don't have to consider my gf as a method for my inner process.

yeah.

but I worry about her health. How can I help it out?
how can I help my budget wise problems as well? yeah.
there are many things to do.

but really there are many things to do?
or what is one thing to solve them all out?
creating my video contents? yes.
that can helps to ask for more incentives and budgets? yeah
that could be done.

and investment wise? yeah
but this part seems a bit difficult.
why? because I don't know what would be great options for it.
at least, if I choose a great person for it, that can help it out. right?
yeah that could be an option for that.

Yes. I don't have to clear all stocks out quickly. just have to sell them out when it takes time. right?
yeah that could be an option, but Coinbase ETF devidends, would it be great option for it?
maybe I have to ask for chat-gpt.

philip fisher, and warren buffit's view, how is coinbase ETF?
what do I have to know about CoinBase?
I'd love to know about Coinbase the company itself.
**but should I understand the America's Cryptocurrency-wise policy and approaches?**
yes I think so.

so what do we need?

1. Look up about Coinbase
2. Ask to Chatgpt CONY
3. Look for the good timing to purchase it
4. Check the America's crypto currency policy and future approach and direction.
