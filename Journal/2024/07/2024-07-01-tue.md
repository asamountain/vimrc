so a bit tired.
yes. english is a bit tired? no. just I wish I could have a better conversation with her.
yeah. actually, just hearing 'Tell more detail' that kind of clue guidance talk were a bit funny.
I don't want to lose my dominence?
well, yeah sometimes I don't know about her status.
when we're together she is so kind, but when we're not, it's a bit confusing.
maybe she likes to be a dominent role.

and maybe I hate to be a dominent role.
why my perception does work in this way.
