This was my first workaway experience and I volunteered here for 1 week. I had an amazing experience here on the farm and Suha and Millie were super welcoming and accommodating.

I really enjoyed meeting the other volunteers and made some good friends on this farm. The farm work was very chilled and not too intensive. most days were spend doing yoga and meditation in the mornings, then around 3 hours of farm work and then the rest of the day was free to chill or Suha would take us to do some outdoor activities like rock climbing, hiking or to the lake for a swim.

we also would play some card games together in the evenings and sit by the fire together. It was a very wholesome experience and I would higly recommend this farm to other volunteers.

Suha and Millie, thank you for hosting me. I didn't do much work during my stay because of the extreme hot weather, but this gave me more time to explore the neighborhood, connect with other volunteers and try new things like card games, rock climbing and fire spinning.
I had a single-bed room. Every morning Susam (a cat) came to my room from the roof and jumped into my bed.
We have only cold water for shower, but it is ok in hot season.
I like the compost toilet. You have a good view. You don't flush with water. You cover your poop with ashes, which is primitive but interesting! It is quite a deep hole underneath so you need to target well.
We planted some seeds. Hope they are growing well now in the rain!
Hope Suha and Millie all the best!

Dear Suha and Millie,

thank you again for the amazing stay and all the opportunities.
I came at the wrong season, right at the end of burning season. Being able to create a worthwhile stay during 40 degrees and a drought, while doing interesting cultural trips and amazing rock climbing, is quite an amazing feat.
The communication was great and there was a lot of room for adjusting the planning etc to the rhythm of the group. Suha and Millie were very welcoming, knowledgeable and just amazing people in general.
I will see you again in the future, take care, and break a leg!

As a first workaway experience, this was a great one. Suha and Millie are fab hosts. Very kind and funny.

We had so much fun during our stay here. We visited interesting local areas and got to swim in Suhas lake. We cooked all together with the fresh fruit and veg provided, did yoga in the mornings and always played games in the evenings. It felt like a little family. Also, if you like rock climbing or want to try it, this is definitely the place for you.

The work was very minimal as it was so hot at this time of year, so we had a lot of time to relax and get to know each other in the chilled out environment.

We would definitely visit here again! And hopefully we will see you both again soon further up North üòä

They showed us the area and we even swam in their lake. They also introduced me to rock climbing which is an amazing sport !

Everyday we would cook all together (with the others volunteers) vegetarian meals with fresh ingredients and always a ton of fresh fruit. We also had yoga session every morning. It felt like home for a week.

My 2 weeks spent here were a fantastic experience and would highly recommend.

Suha and Millie were fantastic hosts. They were kind, generous, inclusive entertaining, honest and just good people in general I have to say.


They cooked and ate with us everyday, always made sure there was plenty of food and fresh fruit for all the volunteers.

We got to go rock climbing several times which I was super excited to do. They even brought beginners along and showed them the ropes.

As a newly qualified yoga teacher I got to teach a yoga class almost every morning I was there which was great experience for me.

They showed us around the area, brought us to local restaurants and sight seeing locations and in creates a really relaxed and kind atmosphere at the farm.

Tbh I was quite inspired by what they've created and would go back in a heart beat. Thanks so much guys üôè.

I spent just over two weeks on this farm and it was the best experience ever! Millie and Suha and the most amazing hosts, they are so kind, funny and generous.

On a typical day we would get up and do yoga, cook and eat A LOT of food, sometimes do light work aha, go to the local market, and in the evening chill around a fire, play cards, maybe dance or just chat. It was such a nice community environment and we ate so well I honestly think I may have doubled in size if I'd stayed here much longer! They took us on regular trips to less touristy local caves, hot springs, a hike, Suha‚Äôs lake/ swamp, local markets and so much more! I was lucky enough to come just before Shambala festival and they took us all there for a couple of days which was was so fun! They also taught us the basics of climbing and took us to local climbing spots on a few of the days which was such an incredible experience that I am so grateful for.

The work was very little, relaxed and always enjoyable because you were in nature and could help with things that suited you more. I did some painting, dug a vegetable patch and chopped down bamboo with a machette which was fun üí™üèªüòé. But this place is definitely more of a place to relax, enjoy nature and have fun.

The place Suha has built here is so special and beautiful and it really did feel like home.

I will always look back on my time at this farm with such happy and funny memories. I miss it already! Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è

Where to start!!! We had a wonderful stay with Suha and Millie it exceeded our expectations! Staying for just under 2 weeks, one day we are gardening, another we are rock climbing and another hiking!

We go to local market everyday in the back of Suha‚Äôs pickup truck and cook amazing vegetarian food as a group!

The work commitment is minimal to a few mornings but you can work as much as you want if you find a project that you enjoy! We spent some mornings gardening and Jonny created a new composting system! Alice painted art around the homestay!

The vibe is laid back and relaxing and you can chill on the hammock in the living area over looking the garden listening to the birds. The accommodation is cozy and clean with mosquito nets!

Suha and Millie are brilliant hosts and they genuinely wanted to experience and spend time with us! We had so much fun! Would love to return one day we highly recommend this Workaway. Thank you!

I spent a month at Suha's farm and I loved it so much. I wish I could have stayed even longer. Suha en Millie are amazing hosts and made me feel so much at home at the farm. It was so nice to be in nature and spend time with the other volunteers. I really loved the community feeling we had with the whole group. We did yoga in the mornings, went to the local market and cooked and ate all together. I have met so many lovely people here and made real connections and friendships.

All the things we did around the farm were a lot of fun, so it didn't feel like we had to work very hard. I loved taking care of our vegetable garden and learning how to harvest bamboo in the river and build things with it.

We went rockclimbing twice a week, which was amazing. I really discoved a new passion there. Suha also took us to the caves nearby, to his own lake and we went for a hike up the mountain. So in addition the work on the farm and a lot of chilling in the hammocks, we did a lot of fun activities as well.

Of my whole backpacking trip, my time on the farm was definately my highlight. I even came back to spend Christmas at the farm, because our community at the farm really felt like family.

Suha and Millie, thank you so much for this amazing experience, I will never forget it. And I will try to come back to the farm, because I already miss it and you guys so much!

I had the most incredible 10 days at Suha's farm. Our group of volunteers from all corners of the globe made it more like a close-knit family. Surprisingly, there wasn't an overwhelming amount of work on the farm, so we pretty much just had a blast! We teamed up to cook some delicious meals, explored climbing spots, soaked in hot springs, and visited the fascinating cocoa gardens and museum nearby.

Suha, our host, is not only a dedicated climber but also an inspiration to all of us, including those who had never tried rock climbing before. His passion for the sport was contagious, and he managed to make even the beginners, myself included, enjoy the experience. Beyond that, Suha is an incredibly warm and caring individual who has created a truly magical garden that felt like a home to each and every one of us.

Thank you, Suha, for this unforgettable experience. I can't wait for the day our paths cross again somewhere in the world. Much love <3

Our 1 week workaway experience at S√ºha's farm was nothing short of extraordinary. S√ºha is not just a host; he's a passionate creator of community and unforgettable memories.

From the serene countryside setting to the variety of activities, S√ºha ensured we felt at home from day one. His contagious enthusiasm and genuine kindness made the experience truly special.

S√ºha goes beyond being a host; he's an adventurer, storyteller, and mentor. The days were filled with hiking, yoga, and learning about sustainable living through permaculture. The open community space became a hub for shared experiences and laughter.

What sets S√ºha apart is his commitment to creating a magical space for personal growth and connection. His farm is more than just a workplace; it's a canvas for shared adventures and camaraderie.

In conclusion, my time at S√ºha's farm was filled with gratitude and inspiration. Thank you, S√ºha, for being an exceptional host and creating a space where memories are made. Looking forward to returning for more adventures.

Best,

The 10 days I spent at the farm were simply amazing. It was definitly too short.

This is the best workaway experience I ever had (3rd one). Suha and Millie were so nice and really helped me to feel like home.
Just to warn you: if you like boring people this place is not for you ... Suha is such an amazing lovely character (a little bit crazy and that's why we love him ahah).

The work was really chill. A few hours per week and the rest of the time you can do whatever you want with other volunteers or alone. This place is perfect for someone who looks for going back to the essential things of life: chilling, meditating, sport (rockclimbing / yoga / hiking), cooking and spending time with amazing people.

Our volunteering at Akirah‚Äôs garden with Suha & Millie was amazing. We stayed there for 2 weeks and it was an experience we will remember forever. We wished we could have stayed longer but we had to leave because of our visa.

From the moment we arrived, we felt very welcome and at home. This farm is a green, relaxing and convivial place.
Our work consisted of cooking together, maintaining the garden and building things out of wood and bamboo.

The farm is also well located, just a 45-minute bus ride from Chiang Mai. There are many activities available in the surrounding area, some of them organised by Suha: cliff climbing (1 or 2 times a week), hiking, cave visits, caf√©s, market, art gallery, etc.

Suha & Millie are very caring and dedicated to their volunteers. For example, they introduce beginners to climbing with a lot of patience and kindness. They also adapt the activities to the group's preferences.

Finally, the other volunteers (around ten young people) contributed greatly to this incredible experience.

Suha was so generous to us during our time with him and many other volunteers! My favorite part about staying with him was cooking and eating together with everyone everyday! We had such a cheap food allowance in return for amazing vegetarian meals together! He was so nice sharing all his climbing knowledge with us! If you are a volunteer looking to go here and have your own climbing gear you should bring it with you! Or if you have gear you don‚Äôt need anymore Suha could definitely use it! We were free to walk around or use his spare moto to get around. I was to scared to sit on the back of a moto so I would walk to the cacao farm nearby to get us all fresh coffee! There is also a super cool museum that you can walk to. But my favorite day was going on a hike up the mountain with Suha! The view was amazing and I felt so accomplished afterwards! We helped out with the garden too! I hope what we transplanted into the garden is still growing! Our room was right by the kitchen and main living space and we were able to use a fan from the living space at night in our room. We will miss swimming in the pond he made himself!

My stay at S√ºha‚Äôs home was my highlight of Thailand! I was only meant to stay a week, and stayed two weeks (which still didn‚Äôt feel long enough). His farm is nestled at the foot of gorgeous mountains in the Mae On district, with incredible rockclimbing, hiking, lakes, and caves all accessible. S√ºha is a passionate mountaineer and climber himself, so he was eager to share this love with his volunteers, and helped teach rock climbing to any new enthusiasts.

As a team with the other Workawayers and S√ºha in the lead (he is an excellent chef!), we prepared delicious meals with the organic produce from both local markets and his garden. It was a wonderful way to learn to cook Thai (and Turkish fusion) food and get a feel for how locals live.

There is a real community vibe in his home, so be prepared to get stuck into cooking, cleaning, general maintenance, and helping in the garden. Take initiative and it will leave a lasting impression. Some of my favourite memories were the games other volunteers taught us, and the foods they prepared from their home country.

I made wonderful friends during my time there - likeminded, great people seem to be drawn to his Sanctury. üå±

S√ºha himself is an inspirational man who embodies the principles of living in the now, and treading lightly in the earth. He gracefully rejects the life of a wage-slave caught in the cycle of buying stuff that doesn't enrich living. I have learned a great deal from him (ranging from permaculture to Thailand to life in general), while also having so much fun! Thank you Suh√º!

I can‚Äôt recommend this opportunity highly enough! I hope to be back :)

S√ºha has created and is nurturing a peaceful oasis in the countryside. He is a fun, charismatic & kind character who has built a lovely space to relax and unwind in the company of new friends. I had a wonderful two week stay here and met a wonderful collection of beautiful people I‚Äôm sure to see again in the future!

S√ºha doesn‚Äôt expect much and the work is minimal, with no more than two hours on working days, which tended to be every second day. Each day we would wake up with yoga, cook together and make trips out to explore the area or head to the markets when we were not working. Activities outside work included climbing, hiking or heading to other places of interest such as the gallery, cave temples or his own lake for swimming. There is also bikes available to get around yourself and a close 7/11.

Suha is a funny, charismatic and endearing character. We extended our stay at his place for a total of almost 2 weeks. We spent most of the time chilling, practicing yoga in the morning, doing grosseries, cooking good food and more chilling. Suha had some things to sort out so the daily help was between none to 2 hours, which was perfectly fine for us by the way. He showed us around quite a lot to nice places as his lake, a huge Buddha cave and the cherry on the cake : to rock climbing ! He really passed us his passion for it and we had such good time doing it. We feel very blessed to have had the opportunity to learn about farming and climbing with such a nice person.

I just wan to thank you to S√ºha one more time from here. I spend 3 amazing weeks in his farm and that was my one the best highlight of my trip. It was my first workaway experience and I think I would never guess that this can be better.

There is a beautiful environment in his farm and being part of it was amazing, the friendships that I made there were unforgettable.

One of the best things about the farm is the experiences that I had. He gave me a change to do lot of things for the first time, such as rock climbing and lake swimming.

Thank you for creating such a wonderful place for people to learn, grow and connect. I really appreciate the opportunity to be a part of your community, and I always will.

We started to set up a place for a new bungalow and many little farm chores. They are also very helpful in the kitchen and keeping the space nice and clean. Because of the very hbot dry and smokey season we chose to chill and have fun more than working. So yes it was really fun to have fun together with Armando and Giada.

We stayed at Suha's farm for 2 weeks at the start of April. Despite the smoky season, our stay was incredibly enjoyable and fun. The farm is peaceful and relaxing, with plenty of things to do around the area. Suha is an active host which does plenty of things for his volunteers, showing them the area around, bringing them rock climbing, teaching how to cook delicious Thai meals, and creating an immense sense of community between the people at the farm. He's truly managed to create a magical place for everyone, and for our first workaway, this was an enchanting experience. We truly hope to return one day as friends, and be able to cultivate Suha's dream even further. Thank you for these amazing two weeks Suha!

He can explain tasks and necessary things well and gives the chance to try out some new things.

They're really curious souls. Both knowledgeable and eager to learn. They understand what's going on, take initiatives with creative ideas and are willing to put on hard work to make them happen.
Also, they gave the best yoga classes and meditation for the people here.
Amazing climbers for their first time on the rock, proving their energy and ability to learn fast.
They are really clean and kept their space tidy.

S√ºha was simply the best host we could have asked for our first workaway experience.

He instantly made us feel at home from the moment we passed the gate. A genuinely knowledgeable and kind-hearted man, with crazy interesting stories to share. He was simply so much fun to spend time with and possibly one of the most caring people we've crossed paths with.

His farm is a true peace haven where we learned about permaculture while enjoying the soothing surrounding nature in rural Thailand. He hosted us in his cozy wooden farm with great rooms (and comfortable bed) and nice open community space, perfect for yoga in the mornings and hanging out in our free time.

The food was amazing and he taught us delicious recipes with farm fresh ingredients for every meal.

He was the best teacher to introduce us to rock climbing. His encouragement went a long way. He transmitted us his passion for the rocks. We are beyond grateful for this.

Bottom line is, we leave with a huge smile on our face and a little bit of melancholia in our heart, with great insights and inspiration for a more sustainable life.

Thank you so much S√ºha. We hope to see you again soon!

Amazing experience at Suha's farm. I enjoyed the rock climbing, the easiness of the farm and the healthy food we cooked every day very much. Our group of volunteers grew together so strong, even if all people were so different and unique. We even went to the shambala festival together, which was an amazing experience itself. I'd really recommend this farmstay to everyone who would like to experience an active, sporty and funny community feeling at a farm. And especially to rock climbers, because Suha will show you the best crags and routes of crazy horse, and if you need it, he always can help you out with a beta. 10/10, and I definitely want to come again!

I just left the farm yesterday, it felt a bit like leaving home! I had such a good time with our host Suha, his son Alaz, the other volunteers and the animals. We worked a little bit, like building a platform for watching the stars (which we did!), planting some new vegetables in the garden and fixing the bench for the fireplace. We also cooked fresh vegetables and delicious things every day. But most amazing was that Suha would take us hiking, rock climbing, swimming, to caves, to a restaurant.. We did so many things and time went by so fast!! Also we did a couple of parties with dancing and singing I loved it!

Suha thank you so much for hosting me, you are so generous and I will miss you, the farm and animals. Next time I come back make a business with 20 baht for my house to sleep and party with little 8 paw furry friends ;)

It is such a peaceful place and Suha has definitely found the balance between working hard and relaxing. Suha has such a big heart and is always going out of his way making sure that all of the volunteers are having a good time - we had so many laughs! We were able to do lots of activities outside of the farm work such as hiking, rock climbing, visiting hot springs, caves, the lake and the museum. Millie's highlights were spending time with Suhas boy Alaz and getting hands on with the building work and Olivia enjoyed going to the local food markets and cooking with fresh ingredients every day. We both felt like we learnt so much from Suha who is incredibly skilled at what he does. We are so grateful for our time at the farm, it really is such a special place and we will definitely be back!

Suha made my first workaway experience a very positive one. He is a person who likes to share: what he has created on his little farm ( which is amazing), share his passion for rock- climbing, for cooking 3 times a day with heaps of fresh vegetables, for Thailand in general. He is so generous and kind and wants everybody on the farm feel good. The mood in the groups ( which were changing while I was there due to some who left and some newcomers) was lovely, everybody felt part if it immediately. I didn' t only meet an amazing host but also wonderful people from all kinds of countries. It felt like 3 weeks although it was only 8 days for me. I felt like leaving a family, isn' t that amazing after a few days...

I spent two weeks in Suha's farm and had a wonderful experience. Suha is a very special and interesting guy. He cares a lot about the volunteers in the farm, makes sure we always have enough food and asked for feedback and if everything is going well every couple of days.
With Suha and the other volunteers we had a little community, Shared great moments of rock climbing, traveling around, going to a festival, movie nights, bonfire, drinking, eating and having fun.
The work in the farm is quite chill and fun (sometimes physical) and you can learn all kinds of different things from Suha. We were building a room, cutting bamboo, harvesting, gardening and cooking different foods. We always had fresh fruits from the garden or the market, and all the ingredients we wanted in order to cook whatever was on our mind. You will not stay hungry in the farm for sure.
The farm was a great place to relex in the nature with Susam the cutest dog, the two cats, the chickens and the other volunteers.

Time passes a bit differently in Suha's farm, and in a good way, the place has as many comforts as one can imagine having in the middle of nowhere, including water, electricity, western toilet, WiFi, and a 7-eleven within biking distance.

Staying at Suha's was amazing. He made sure that we felt welcomed and at home as soon as he picked us up in Chiang Mai. His farm is beautiful and it's amazing to think that he built it all himself. The work is light and you have a lot of freedom to explore the area and there's a lot you can see! We went rock climbing, visited a local bar which was really fun (and random hahaha), we went to an art museum, a cave (with a temple inside) and there are also hot springs nearby! Suha is not only a really interesting person himself, but he also knows a lot of very interesting people who we had the pleasure to meet. It's really easy to talk to Suha when you have concerns about anything, it's really fun to talk to him and he knows quite a lot about farming and carpentry, all from volunteering himself! Sara and Alaz were there for a couple of days and we did morning yoga together, which was awesome, and Sara told us a little bit about different plants in the farm and their medicinal benefits which was really interesting. I truly feel like I now have a home in the east of Chiang Mai and can't wait to come back to visit when I'm in the area again. Thank you for everything Suha, see you soon! ü§ç

The Workaway at organic farm was an amazing experience. The farm itself is in the middle of nature and everything is built of wood. I spent two weeks at the farm in february and because of the upcoming smokey season, there wasn't so much real farming to do, so we learned a lot about working with bamboo, composting,... As a rockclimber I especially loved this place because we got to spend so much time in the nearby rock climbing area. More than only the farm experience, these two weeks were also so interesting and enriching to live together with people of different nationalities, having a daily routine together, we cooked the best food, we did yoga, we explored the area, we got to learn about eachothers views on life during the long evening at the fire,... Suha is always doing his best to get everyone involved, make sure everyone has a good time, to teach a bunch of stuff, and just to spend time together. It was also very interesting for me to talk to Sara and get to know more about Thai Medicine and healing methods. And their son Alaz is the best! I am incredibly grateful for this experience and would recommend it to everyone!!!

Staying at Suha‚Äôs farm was amazing! We would wake up in the morning, meditate and do yoga with the other volunteers, then go on spontaneous hikes, rock climbing, swimming, or we would work on the farm. Suha, Sarah and Alaz welcomed me with open arms and I will miss all the fun talks, debates, and cooking sessions with the whole group. They are exceptionally selfless and kind people who really showed me a new and refreshing view on life and sustainability.

Thank you very much for this wonderful experience, especially for introducing rock climbing to me! :)

Sam and Dani was so amazing that i can't find words to explain in the first point. We had great times together, did lots of work and enjoyed so many free times together. Besides their super lovely characters, this couple is so responsible while working. They were always with me whenever i needed help. Also very skillful. We did lots of wood/bamboo work, some farm works, taking care of animals and many more. Sam and Dani also great at cooking and cleaning. We had so nice Brasillian dinners and their amazing coctails.
I am also so happy to teach them rock climbing, and giving them a lifetime hobby.

It was one of the best things we experienced in Thailand. Sharing time with Suha and his lovely family was amazing. Really chill vibe, lots of climbing, great time cooking fresh and healthy food all of us together, taking time to observe nature (rain, soil, plants, animals, stars, moon, sun)... If we have to describe the whole experience, we should write a book about it. But just to highlight a few of what we carry in our memories with such a grateful feeling:
# Suha is such an enthusiastic climber, really willing to share what he knows and to make other people love this sport as much as he does (if you're already a climber or have an interest in learning it, I guess there's no better workaway in Thailand).
# Working there doesn't feel like working at all, it's always fun!!
# Nice chats around the fire!
# Alaz (the son) is sooo nice! I don't remember meeting such a thoughtful kid... We really liked sharing time with him.
# Sarah has an amazing peaceful vibe. Just talking to her made me much more aware of my tone of voice, how much I speak and how much I listen... She also knows a lot about plants for medicinal and nutritional ends.
If you're fortunate as we were, you will leave Mae On with friends for life <3 <3
We definitely recommend their place!

During her stay not much farming going on because of the dry season but we did many little works together. Wood and bamboo working. And mostly enjoying lots of free times.

Suha is an amazing host! He does his very best to comfort all his workawayers.
When I was at Suha's place, it was as close to the dry and smokey season, hence no work on the land. We had a lot of free time, which we spend cooking, reading and chatting at the terrace or Suha took us out on a climbing trip or to the lake for a swim. The climbing was really great! Wonderful rocks :)
We did work on some projects: we collected bamboo for a little house and a raft for the lake. We had a lot of freedom to complete the work.
I slept in the dorm, which was basic, but perfect. Sheets were clean and Suha asked me several times whether I needed something else. As we couldn't arrange a grab pickup, Suha took us to the village to take the bus from there.
Thanks a lot for your good care, Suha!

This workaway will stay in my memory and heart for a long time. I originally wanted to stay only a week, but I ended up staying more than a month, and I would go back again... I loved the farm from the first moment and knew it was the perfect place for me. Everyone accepted my bad-basic English and I stopped being shy to speak! I felt here like my second home.

Suha takes care of the volunteers like family and spends all his time with us. We were like a family! Going on hikes together, climbing, shopping at the street market, cooking and eating, working on the farm, yoga, watching movies, relaxing, talking around the fire and so much more. All the time together.

He taught us a lot and showed us new things. I have so many experiences. Suha's family son Alaz and wife Sara, are also amazing!

I went to the farm with that I was ready to work hard and I left having learned to really relax, enjoy just being, not planning, climbing and lots of first time experiences.

My time on the farm will stay in my heart forever, the best thing in my life. Thank you so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Suha‚Äôs farm was my first Workaway experience and it exceeded every expectation I had immeasurably. This permaculture farm radiates positive energy that you will feel the day you arrive. The work was always enjoyable and was a great way to learn about the permaculture lifestyle! When we weren‚Äôt cooking delicious food or drinking by magnificent fires, we would go to surrounding areas for rock climbing. One weekend, a group of us took a road trip to Chiang Rai for rock climbing and camped in a cave! Along the way, we stopped at the White, Black, and Blue Temple. Suha‚Äôs zeal for sharing Thai culture, the outdoors, and permaculture makes this farm a phenomenal experience.

My stay here is already one year ago (August 2019) but I still have a smile on my face when I think back to the days I spent in that peaceful place with such caring hosts and the lovely community. Sara and Suha are warm-hearted persons, I felt welcome and comfortable from the beginning until the end!

The amount of work was really fair and there was a lot of free time. Food was just great, fresh, healthy, organic from the own garden or nearby markets. Sara and Suha showed us around, took us out for excursions, markets, local restaurants etc. I loved to start the day with Sara's yoga classes and I am grateful for the opportunity to give my first own sessions in that safe space.

It was clear that for both of them workaway means really sharing and giving a good experience to the people they receive. So if you want to have a great time and know the real rural Thailand, this is your place to go :).

Suha, Sara and their son form a very welcoming and attentive intercultural family. The pace is rather "quiet" and the activities are organized between the volunteers according to the desires of each person.
The living conditions are very pleasant, ideal for getting away from the Thai city.
Only regret: not having been able to stay longer (because welcomed at the last minute and having to leave room for other volunteers)!

Suha, Sara et leur fils constituent une famille interculturelle tr√®s accueillante et tr√®s √† l'√©coute. Le rythme est plut√¥t "tranquille" et les activit√©s s'organisent entre les volontaires selon les envies de chacun. Le cadre est tr√®s agr√©able, id√©al pour s'√©loigner de la ville thailandaise.
Seul regret : ne pas avoir pu rester plus longtemps (car accueillie en derni√®re minute et devant laisser de la place pour d'autres volontaires) !

Sara was super kind and helpful, she helped me to better understand how to use plants in order to heal my lungs. The farm is a precious space, full of positive energy, delicious food and people coming from all around the world... I found this experience truly insipiring. The daily work isn't hard, we built a bamboo pee-hider, we did some garden works (planting, moulching, watering, collecting Okra) and some wood works. We also had a lot of free time to enjoy the environment, the waterfalls, a stunning hiking on the mountain or just to read a book.

I‚Äôd always amazing people around me, it was super interesting to sit around the fire with a few drinks and talk about life. Everybody was so kind and lovely.
I‚Äôve learned a lot in this time, from permaculture, wood and bamboo work to how to make a curry or papaya salad.
Suha showed me how to climb, which become my new hobby.
It was never boring on the farm, Suha was always open to show something new, or you just crap the bicycle and go somewhere by your own.
There are hot springs, an impressive cave, we hiked on a mountain or went to a market.
Everyday something new..

Thank you so much for everything, Suha!

The simple life, about what I learned a lot, the yoga lessons at 6 o'clock in the morning giving by inspiring Sara, the cooking together with all of the volunteers, the hiking to the top of the mountain, the carpentry, the rock climbing wall, the fresh food out of the garden. There is so many amazing things to do and to learn. To sit in the back of Suhas 40 years old pick up truck just always made me a big smile on my face.

This is my first Workaway experience and I'm glad to say I enjoy every bit of it. Suha, Sara and Alaz are wonderful people and a lovely family. They're truly passionate about self-sufficiency, permaculture and organic farming and are eager to share the knowledge with anyone who's interested to learn. It's so impressive how everything in the farm is built from scratch and all systems run efficiently such that nothing is wasted.

Even though I arrived at a non-peak season, I still managed to help with some work: feeding chickens, planting seeds, carpentry, collecting firewood and cooking. Suha is a knowledgeable and caring host. I'm not experienced in farmwork at all but he patiently guided me, along with the volunteers for all the work we did.

On days we didn't work, we went hiking, local markets and just chilled around. I enjoyed paying with Alaz as well -- we practised Thai and watched cartoons together at the balcony of a hut in evenings.

During our three weeks with them we got to experience rural thai life, learned tons of new skills and made new friends from all over the world. We built a deck near the river, planted tons of Ocra and painted a building.

You won't get bored if you are willing to help, and will learn a lot about being resourceful in this kind of evironment.

We had great time together with Raphaelle, she stayed in our farm around a week , but her help was really appreciated.She helped me about taking care of my animals, all type of farming work, wood work and so on.She was really great at kitchen too.Basically she was ready in every time whenever i need help.Also for few days she was my only volunteer in the farm, and she was able to do all type of tasks alone.Very responsible great volunteer that i can recommend to all other hosts.She is more than my volunteer now please welcome any time again my dear friend Raphalle : )

I stayed 1 week with Suha, Sara and Alaz for my first workaway experience. The three of them were very friendly and generous people from whom I have learned a lot about organic farming but also about local meals, yoga, thai medicine...
The work at the farm was diverse and instructive, from gardening (weeding, watering, seeding...) to carpentry. During my free time, i visited nice places around by bike, played cards with the dynamic Alaz or simply relaxed in the farm.
I am highly impressed by this family who has succeeded in building this amazing place from scratch and in accordance with their environmental convictions. I am looking forward to return one day to see how the project evolves.
Thank you so much for this first experience and wish you all the best for the future.

Although I only stayed for a really short time and it was dry season where there were not much work, I still have learnt a lot from Suha and Sara. They are very open and willing to share their knowledge to the volunteers. We learnt about permaculture, woodwork, biodynamics, Yoga, Thai herbal medicines and of course the making of papaya salad! I felt extra lucky to get to visit the Thai medicine school also!
The work we have done was watering the plants, feeding chickens, some woodwork, helping to make dinner etc.
It is a very nice family and they attract interesting travellers to the farm. I enjoyed playing with the energetic young man Alas also!
This is one of the most beautiful farms I've visited and there are lots of good energy there. I wish to visit again in the future.

I stayed at Suha's and Sara's farm for a week in December and I had a great time!

The hospitality was great, i felt like visiting my family abroad. The hosts really care for their guests and make anything possible to make them feel at home. They also speak perfect English which makes the communication easy.
The farm is ideal to relax, enjoy nature and detox. I especially enjoyed the fresh air and jungle sounds while sleeping in the wooden house. There is also a lot of pure beautiful nature around to visit with the bicycle or bike.
The food is simple, healthy, vegeterian and mostly organic. Rice with vegetables and/or eggs is the usual meal for breakfast, lunch and dinner. For dessert I mostly had delicious bananas and papayas from the farm.
The work depends on what is needed and what the strengths of the volunteers are. It can be farm work, construction or cooking. I learned some things in all those three areas. It usually starts in the morning and lasts about 3-4 hours.

I definitely recommend a stay at this farm and hope to visit Suha, Sara and Alas soon again in the future.

We had a really good time staying with Suha and Sara at their wonderful permaculture farm. Despite the driest season of the year when there is not too much to be done, Suha took his time to explain to us about permaculture, plants, compost, chicken and sustainable living, while Sara taught us yoga, Thai massage, and medicinal plants.

When we had free time, we also had lot of fun with their son and other awesome fellow volunteers. We went hiking, shopped at the local market, cooked together, and enjoyed game nights. Saha and Sara are kind, patient, and loving.

We had great experience! Thank you Suha and Sara for having us. See you again next time.

This was my very first experience on a sustainable eco farm and I loved it. Suha is a very patient and lovely guy you can learn a lot from. He showed us woodworking, introduced us in farming and gave advice how to build a farm. He teaches with patience and pleasure, so it is also understandable for beginners. Outside the working times we had many communal activities, such as cooking, daytours to the mountain and cave, lessons about massage and biodynamics and the yoga practice by his competent and sympathetic wife Sara. Moreover both care that the harmony in the group is maintained. They put much emphasis on talking in case there is any problem (but there has never been one). Everyone respects each other. Overall, this project is more than just a place to work at. It is a familiar community in which you can learn a lot for your life. I am thankful for being there and I hope once I can return to this wonderful place! You'll stay in my heart and in my mind!

First of all sorry Suha for the delay! Being at Suha's place was an amazing experience. In fact it was our first time in a permaculture farm and we learned a lot! We needed just ten minutes to feel like home as you can feel the love and the beautiful energy Suha and the past volunteer invested in this place. Despite the dry season we always found something to do. Working with the soil, building furniture was so much fun, exhausting but in a good way as you can see in the end of the day that it was all worth it, so rewarding and inspiring.
Thank you Suha, Sarah and Alas.Thank you to the other volunteers who felt like family. We hope that you enjoyed your deserved holidays and that we will come again.

I spent a bit more than a week at the farm, there were at least 4 other volunteers all the time. Work wasn't hard, mostly taking care of the plants and chickens, planting seeds and transplanting, sometimes digging some holes - if someone was okay with this. Volunteers have either private or shared rooms, there's a lot privacy and it's comfortable. Food is always fresh and great, Sara makes the best natural yogurt ever! Sara and Suha are nice, open minded and helpful people. Was nice to listen about their life, sharing the knowledge, meals and time. I hope to be back there!

Even though it was dry season which isn't the best for farming but I still learned many things about permaculture, cooking (the food was amazing, especially Sarah's cakes and the sticky rice mango was amazing!).

I had the most amazing time staying with Suha, Sarah and Alaz at this beautiful permaculture farm! As soon as I arrived I felt welcomed by everyone. The farm is surrounded by mountains, trees and natural beauty. It also attracts many interesting and cool volunteers. I really enjoyed spending time each night by the campfire and talking with Suha, Sarah, and the other volunteers. It felt like home away from home! I also had a lot of fun hanging out with Alaz, their 7-year old son! He taught me some cool dance moves. Suha is an awesome host who is very helpful and knowledgeable about many topics, including building and permaculture. We had a lot of fun together! Sarah is an incredible yoga teacher who led amazing classes every morning. I loved waking up to her calming voice! She is an excellent teacher and is also very knowledgeable about Thai medicine. Both Sarah and Suha gave me plenty of advice when I wanted to go to the caves, hot springs and museum near by. All of these attractions were amazing and accessible on the bicycle they have. If you‚Äôre looking to escape from the city and see some nature in a laid back and friendly environment, this is the perfect place to go. I hope to come back to visit Suha, Sarah, and Alaz again!

I stayed with Suha, Sara and Alaz for almost 2 weeks , but it definitely wasn't enough for me.
I learned a lot from Suha about gardening, building, composting, permaculture and even cooking :)
In the farm the days started with yoga. (thanks to Sara) After yoga we cared the chickens and watered the seeds and then had breakfast together. In the evenings the work is watering the garden and caring the chickens again. These are the routine works. Other than these we did some building , planting, composting, transplanting the seeds, harvesting, cleaning. I did all the work happily and with passion, I wish I could give them more, but it was my first workaway experience and I'm just starting to learn about working in a farm.
Besides work one day Suha took all of us for climbing and hiking to a mountain. It was one of my best experiences. A couple of days he took us to the noodle shop and to a nearby local bar. Also every week we go to the local market twice and buy some delicious vegetables. We always cooked our food together and in the evenings we made a fire and chat around it. You can see lots of stars at night and it was amazing. I never wanted to leave there and still missing that farm so much.
There are so much places to visit nearby , like caves, hot springs, etc. that you can go on your day offs. Because I don't know how to ride a bicycle , Suha even dropped us to the cave with his car. If you choose to stay in the farm on your day offs, it is also really fun and peaceful. You can always play with the cute dog Susam and 2 cats Ayu and Kara. On weekends I sometimes played lego with Alaz and it was so much fun.
Actually we did so many other things together and I miss all of them. This farm made me change in a good way and I'm thankful to them for these changes. I hope I can come again soon.

it's a late feedback though....
8 days just passed so fast like an arrow. I am so grateful for having the opportunity to be involved in this farm, that experience was priceless. Even i had no related experience or good knowledge in this field, i was welcomed. We built the frame for chicken house, from digging the soil to building the roof, didn't even spent two days to finish. Also we did some rocks filling to the muddy road outside of the farm house.

Suha was always willing to teach us and answer our questions all the time. He's easygoing and caring to the volunteers. I could totally feel his enthusiasm and persistence on living a sustainable life and conserve the environment,also very conscious of what the world is going on. What he shared to us was inspiring. He's chill but wild on driving his motorbike XD Also Sara, she made us feel like home and comfortable all the time, always share a lot of her knowledge on herbs, health etc, to us. i real appreciate their spirits and energy.You could feel a genuine interaction between human being with them. They are a family full of positive energy and it's contagious because they shared. And what i have learned during the stay definitely benefit me for life!
I miss you guys a lot!

We are so thankful for this wonderful experience and the opportunity to meet this inspirational family. Suha and Sara were so welcoming and we felt right at home very quickly. Their son, Alaz, is a sweet and energetic 6 year old who loves to play games...checkers, uno, and 3 rocks! Suha and Sara genuinely care about nature, stewarding the land and minimizing their impact to the earth. Suha is easygoing and is more than willing to share his knowledge of permaculture and the process of creating an organic farm from a former GMO corn field. Sara has a wealth of knowledge about medicinal herbs and plants. She taught us a number of plants and their uses; we even got to put them into practice. For example: after a night of drinking we made "hangover tea" from Laurel Clock Vine and rice and learned how to use the leaves of a local plant to stop the bleeding from a leech bite. In the mornings Sara would teach a wonderful yoga class, which was such a perfect way to start the day. The farm work was interesting and enjoyable and included planting herbs, feeding the chickens and ducks, watering the garden, building a new raised garden bed and helping a little with the construction of a new dormitory. We enjoyed cooking many shared healthy meals and spending the evenings hanging out together on the outdoor yoga sala. Thank you Suha, Sara and Alaz for sharing your beautiful home with us and teaching us so much! We hope we can come back and stay longer next time :)

After landing in Bangkok, I moved straight away from this big city to join Suha and Sara‚Äôs project in the west of Chiang Mai.
After almost 3 days of traveling, they welcomed me warmly and in my little bamboo house I was feeling like home.
4 others workawayers was already there and very fast I was feeling a member of the team.
Suha and Sara have a big knowlege in medicinal remedy with natural plants they grow in their garden.
And they also teached me many Tha√Ø recepy especially the succulent papaya salad, not so easy to prepare, more like 1h of bodybuilding for your arms!
I also chose this workaway because Suha is a climber and they live just 4km away from Crazy Horse. We went climbing 2 times, the spot HeartWall is beautiful, full of monkeys !

You will be able to learn a lot about permaculture while getting your hands dirty in the garden, be part of the construction project and do wood working (cleaning, cutting, nailing it...) !
The food is just awesome, fresh vegetables and fruits in the fridge to eat whenever you want.
There were really good vibes with the other workawayers, we cooked every meal together, visited the area, shared a drinks around the bonfire at night...
Also, start to train playing checker, you will have to play with Alaz and he's quite good. You will also need to pet one adorable dog and two cats :)
Our only regret is that we couldn't stay more !

Karen had a garden before so is good with farming skills. She was working hard all of the time with planting new seedlings, making vegetable beds, watering and helped with the animals. Martin worked mostly on the new building and we put up the walls and steps and did the framing to keep the rain out. We had other workawayers here and everyone was like family.

We stayed with Suha, Sara, and Alaz for two weeks and had a great time working on their organic farm and helping them build a new guest house for others who will be staying there in the future. We ate three generous vegetarian meals a day with much of the fruit and produce picked from their garden and they took us around to the local markets, a museum, nearby restaurants for lunch and took us hiking on two different occasions. Additionally, Sara led us all through yoga every morning. The rooms were primitive but sufficient and private and the showers only had cold water, but after working on a hot day it was refreshing. They can house up to six workawayers and are building another guest house so you are always having interesting conversations with people from other countries. If you are in the Chiang Mai area and are interested in learning about permaculture farming, we would recommend you stay here.

Suha, Sara, Alaz‚Ä¶
What an amazing experience, what lovely moments, what a great atmosphere‚Ä¶.
Joan and I spent 8 days with this family in a spectacular spot in north of Thailand. At the beginning we were searching for tasks and schedule but there you are not told what you have to do and this is your job. There you find the spirit of collaboration and you pick up the work as it is necessary to be done.
One of the best things about there, was the circle. Every two three days you have circles and you can say about your happy or sad moments there, your expectations and also listen to others.
We also had great adventure in the mountain nearby where nobody regularly goes. In the mountain Joan had twisted ankle on the way back but Suha, Sara and all other workawayers took care of him in the best way and treated him very well and was no pressure for anything. That`s why we are so grateful to them. We enjoyed, we laughed and we learned from each other a lot.
Thank you so much and we hope to see you somewhere sometime in this little planet again.

Cheers,

Dear Suha, Sarah and little bay Alaz,

Thank you so much for the beautiful time at you farm.
It was my first workaway experience and I had a great time at this magic place. The plan was to stay just for a week, just to explore more about sustainable farm life, but it's end up nearly in a month.

The day began with yoga classes, which was Sarah teaching mostly everyday - beautiful slow flow yoga, perfect to start the day full with energy. After yoga class, we had breakfast together and start to work before the sun comes out. For example - We build the toilet compost together, maked vegetables garten, planting seeds and trees, did some wood work, harvesting, caring the garden and caring the chicken and more. Sarah has a lot of knowledge about the herbs and thai medicine, you can speak with her about nature medicine, which is great to know! Their lovely son Alaz is a little smart and energetic boy, who can speak more then 4 languages. I miss to play card with him!

We went every third day to the locals market to get all the fresh food. We cooked lunch and dinner everyday, prepared the food together, was singing in the kitchen and had fun and been happy to have all the fresh ingredients and food to cooking in the beautiful open kitchen in the nature. Suha took us for climbing and hiking many times and up to the mountains. Sometimes in the evening we was sitting for a hours and talking at the fair and had some drink. On days off we had the opportunity to take the bickles to explore the area (caves, mountains, waterfalls, markets and sorroundings nearby).

I learn a lot about permaculture, farming, planting, thai cooking, building and rock climbing as well in this time. It was more then workaway for me! Suha and Sarh they alway open to talk and to help. It was always a peaceful atmosphere at the farm and I had a lot of fun. Its became like little home for me. I wish you all the best and thank you for everything! And hope to see you in the future again. I miss you already!

Natalia stayed in our farm more than 3 weeks.And her help for us was so precious.She helped me a lot that i couldnt find the exact words for this review for a while.I mean it was beyond the help for a volunteer can give in a farm.She is very responsible, easy going and experienced about many things.Very confident at living in the nature.
She helped cooking, cleaning, playing with my son( he was so sad when she was leaving) , taking care of animals( i know my chickens and ducks missing her : ) planting, weeding , building , even painting ( yes she is an artist too: )
And besides the whole work she is a great company about enjoying the life, exchanging ideas and so on..
I strongly recommend her for any hosts who needs a great and trustworthy volunteer..

Dear Sara and Suha and Alaz,
I had great time at your farm! Its is a wonderful place with beautiful wooden buildings in the stunning nature. Everyday we woke up doing Yoga, made breakfast together with the other amazing volunteers, worked in the garden and had other fun activities like hiking up a mountain or riding with bicycles, exploring the village and sorroundings nearby. I just spend a week at the farm, but learned a lot about permaculture, sustainable living and I want to thank you for your hospitality, generosity and wonderful time we all shared together!

We were staying with this nice and happy family for a week, Suha helped us to arrive to his place very kindly and we felt very comfortable. The attitude is very easy going and if you are interested in farming this is a very good place to learn about it. Thank you Suha and Sara, we had a great time.
Ps Suha even took us to rock climbing fun day and one day we drove by bicycle to the amazing cave (dont miss that) so they provide a very nice combination between work, rest and cool activities.
And Allaz is a very cool kid. Miss him already!

Yara and Devo stayed with us for a short time but we got real great help from this wonderful couple.Devo's skills about building and tools i think the best so far since we started our farm community.And Yara was amazing about farming . They have such a huge knowledge and experience about living in the nature.Besides all the work we have done here, enjoying our free times together in our farm was so unique.Also Devo my son thanks you so much for the flute you made from bamboo : ) I believe they will be great hosts in their lands in Canada.And hopefully one day i will be so happy to be their volunteer : )

We really struggled to leave, Suha and Sara are warm and kind people who I hope take us up on our offer to visit in Canada ;)
We had the opportunity to meet Suha's family from Turkey, drink a night or two away, share culture, laugh and became aware of the strength of their character and hearts. We climbed rock faces and mountains, built a compost toilet, ate delicious nutritious meals and did yoga every morning we could. Their son Alaz is a bright, energetic boy who we'll miss playing with and learning about all the animals he knows about.
I wish all the best, and hope we had an impact as strong as Suha and Sara left on us. <3

It was my first workaway experience and the best time in Thailand.

They are so lively and pleasent people who are also so sensitive about nature. They have a great aim like building a wooden house to provide accommadition to travelers in return volunteering in their farm as a commune. They use an old house's woods without cutting even one tree while they are making this house. They dispose and recycle the garbages, plan to use sun power and aim producing their own electricity for this house.

S√ºha has traveled around whole Asia so you can get useful informations and have great chat with him. Og√ºn is an expert carpenter, you can learn so much things about woods thanks to him. And S√ºha's wife Sara is a very kind people who you can talk about Thai culture and her point of interest, herbs. And i need to mention about one more amazing one, Alaz : ) He is a 5 years old boy whom you will be addicted : ) He is pure of energy and mirth.

Also there is a lovely dog, Susam, chickens, a few vegetable garden and a banana tree : )

As well as all, you can watch the stars in a really clear sky while you are sipping your drink in front of a fire, in the garden of your bungalow or tent.

I believe you will have a great time and wont want to leave there : )

We are very grateful to Suha and Sara for spending a month with them and their son Alaz on their farm, we already miss them, especially Lana will miss the Uno evenings with Alaz. We really had a great time with our children there and have always felt comfortable. We have learned a great deal about perma culture, about tasty vegetarian dishes and about a simple and sustainable life. On the weekends we often did trips together to the Cave, waterfall or hot spring with the family and the other volunteers, about which we are very thankful, so you could see a bit more of chang mai. We can only recommend this loving family and wish you a great time with suha, sara, alaz and not to forget susam a great dog to cuddle :-)

We loved this German family.They stayed with us 1 month.And we enjoyed everyday.Kevin , Sabrina and Lanna were always ready whenever help needed.And little baby Sofia , my youngest volunteer ever , was giving us happiness with her wonderful smiles..
Ohh never forget Amunet too.My first dog volunteer hahaa. She didnt listen to much but she is well manner dog.
Sabrina's english is perfectly fine about communicating.And although Kevin and Lannas english is not very good yet, this situation has never been a problem about understanding each other.There were no language barrier at all.
Kevin is a strong man he helped me a lot about building work while Sabrina's help was really significant at farm work and especially kitchen help.I will never forget hee huge papaya salads every dinner : )
So there is a lot to say but to be simple i definitely recommend this nice family to any hosts in the world.
Hope to see u guys one day again.

My partner and I stayed with Suha, Sara and Alaz for 1 week in late September. I can‚Äôt recommend this experience enough - we had such a good time. Suha taught us so much about permaculture and sustainable farm life. Sara lead us through some yoga classes and treated us by cooking some excellent food. We were so well fed. We had lots of day trips around the area. We got to work with some amazing volunteers from many different parts of the world. If we weren‚Äôt continuing our trip into Laos, we would have definitely stayed much longer. Suha made us feel like another family member. This workaway is for you if you are looking for a break from the city life and touristy scene and would like to trade it in for the quiet, beautiful mountain-scape. We hope to one day return! Thanks so much Suha!

Last July I spent a week on the farm and it was a wonderful experience. Suha is always kind, sociable and willing to teach: working with him I have made new exciting experiences such as cutting wood, building a roof, cultivating, etc. You can make interesting conversations with him on any subject, from vegetables to the meaning of life :-) Sara too is kind and knows many useful things, especially on plants and medicine, and is ready to help the volunteers in case of need. Playing with Alaz is a great exercise for the imagination and gives a lot of satisfaction, because he is a very affectionate child. The farm is a simple place surrounded by nature, ideal for those who want to relax during a long journey. Highly recommended! Thanks Suha and Sara, see you soon !!!

I have to admit that staying with this beautiful family was the best experience I had in Thailand. We were there for 15 days and if we wouldn't have to leave because of our visa we would've definitely stay longer. We were fortunate to be the first people to stay in their new wooden houses and cook in their amazing kitchen just opposite the yoga platform. The whole set is very welcoming but what makes it even better is the warm heart of this family. I did learn a lot about self sustainable farms and plants as well as some building basics which my boyfriend and my brother got involved more, I have to admit. It is not only the whole experience there or yoga lessons that Sarah is so good at, that made me fall in love with the place. It was the passion and love that this family puts in what they do and how they made 3 strangers feel like home.
Thank you Suha and Sarah for having us, we had an amazing experience!

I stayed with with Suha and Sara for almost 2 weeks and had a brilliant time! Both are super lovely people - Suha very clever and passionate about permaculture, working with the land and creating things himself, and Sara very knowledgeable about natural medicine, herbs and making all sorts of thing from plants and fruits. The little boy Alaz is a ball of fun who loves to play and kept us all occupied. I felt like I became a part of the family very quickly, cooking and eating together every night, with beautiful fresh ingredients, and lots of good conversation. We had the chance to go rock climbing, which was fantastic, and then also hiked up one of the mountains nearby. Suha was very willing to show us as much of the area as he could. I loved working in the garden, planting and growing seedlings, turning the soil - very rewarding and inspiring work.
Would recommend this work away to anyone as long as you are interested in living with nature and good company!
Thank you so much Suha, Sara and Alaz!

Adam & Autumn stayed with us for a week and helped out A LOT! Adam is a super handyman. He learns new tasks quickly and enjoys working. Probably the most efficient helper with carpentry that we've had. Autumn is also helpful and personable, always pleasant to work with. She helped out with housework, cooking, gardening, gave a reiki treatment, a yoga class and took some photos for us. Both are easy-going, good-natured, and great with children. I would highly recommend them to other hosts.

Sara and Suha are an amazing pair of kindhearted caring people. Adam and I only spent a week at their home, but in that short time they made us feel like family! We spent our days helping in the construction of their guesthouse and tending to the gardens and chickens. We perpaired and ate meals together and had lots of fun with their beautiful son Alaz! At 5 years old this brilliantly child can speak three languages: English, Turkish, and Thai! His curious nature and bright spirit are sure to bringing you lots of smiles! On our days of leisure we were brought to some of the local sights like the umbrella making place, Naga Cave and the hot springs! They also shared tons of information with us about their culture, the customs and the language that was very helpful for our travels. We were both so humbled to be a part of this family and we know that we will come back during our next travel!

This was one of the most special experiences of my trip. I was here for just a week and it felt like I was part of the family. Sara and Suha are such welcoming persons, sharing their home and trusting me to play and make fun with their son Alaz, who always has an incredible positive energy. Very inspiring to see a family being so open to strangers and sharing their day to day life with them.

Besides that, they‚Äôre also working on an awesome plan, trying to become self sufficient! Suha showed me around the place, explaining their water supply system and solar panel. He and their friend and carpenter Ogun, also let me help building the dorms out of used wood willing to explain the machines and just letting me try, while I had no experience in carpentry at all. Sara taught me some things about thai medicine and natural products and gave two yoga lessons I could attend during my stay!

In short, I learned so much in just a week while having a fun and chilled stay! Keep up the good work. I hope to come back when the yoga salon is finished and we can work in the garden :)
