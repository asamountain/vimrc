I need to visualize a lot of thing to do? yes

if I really want to having my own farm in melbourne I have to understand what should I do for now.
the inventories, what they want to know can be seriously important.
the customers and the people who want to know about the world how it can be changed. especially the climate change things can be important.

but what kind of things should I have to present to them?
I can tell them what they want to know. the climate change can be changed but the UN report can be useful for it. I don't want to make.

3.4 oz would be great.
